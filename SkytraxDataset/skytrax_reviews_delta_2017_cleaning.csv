Process of rescheduling was somewhat stressful. Westjet and Delta staff were helpful but their systems do not interact well. Worked with Westjet gate attendant then followed that with calls to Delta, Westjet and finally Delta again to sort out a flight change for the next day for a Bangor to RDU routing. Flight out of Bangor was delayed. Gate agent at Bangor was greeting passengers as they reached the gate area, offering snacks, pre-checking bags, thanking everyone for flying Delta. He was also proactive in assisting those who needed help with wheelchairs or pre-boarding. Flight BGR-LGA was okay - crew efficient and professional. Connection in LGA went okay, flight to RDU boarded a bit early but pilot came on the PA and sounded very frustrated as he advised us of a last minute route change from Air Traffic Control. This caused a slight delay in take off. Flight was okay as well though very unusual - we flew very low (about 5,000 feet according to Flight Tracker) for most of the route. This made the trip a bit longer than scheduled but the pilot kept us informed so not a big issue. Flight attendants also efficient and professional.

As we were right at the back of the plane, we were not particularly surprised to find that there was no choice left for us when the first meal was served. However, when it happened again on the second meal, I have to say that I was pretty annoyed. They had also completely run out of the icecream and there was no excuse for just not having enough of something that was not a choice. I cannot understand why, having disappointed us the first meal, they could not have served us first on the second meal, the kitchen was directly behind us and they had to pass us to start serving from the front again. We ended up having nothing at all to eat and my husband was ravenous.

We were informed that we all had to deplane and was told it would be a few minutes. After a half hour of no information, I finally talked to the customer service. They informed me that it was going to be another hour. The hour passes then it's two hours. Then three. I talk to customer service to see what I could do about missing my connection. I was given 3 options; have a six and a half layover to wait for the next plane, fly back to Charlotte and try again in three days, or give up and get a flight on a more reliable airline. On top of this awful situation, in the past I have been snapped at by customer service, delayed four and a half hours because a kid puked in the aisle, ignored by chatting FA, and left stranded in another country for 18 hours.

I have to mention that our connecting flight in SLC was 30 minutes away from the PDX flight landing. This combo of flights was offered by the company I did not choose it specifically. Temperature outside was about 40 degrees no snowing, no raining and they had to deice the plane. Only that they started doing it at 6:15AM. Again, Our departure was scheduled at 6:00AM they start deicing at 6:15. Great customer service, especially after we got stuck on the tarmac for another hour so our plane ended up taking off at 7:15AM. We missed the connection in SLC. I go to the counter lady who of course told us that she will rebook us the second day. I said fine, so who is gonna cover our hotel and expenses? She said we do not cover that type of stuff when a delay is because of the weather? And here I give up, when you were already late with the boarding you act incompetent and start to deice the plane with 15 minutes after the departure time, when outside is clear sky and 40 degrees? When I brought up all these arguments to her she did not know what excuse to find and she said that she will not cover our expenses and she is the boss so I cannot talk with anybody else. So after showing a huge level of incompetency to your clients that paid for your tickets, you do not even try to make it up to them?

At 7:30 pm we got a text saying our flight was cancelled, my husbands flight got rebooked to get into Las Vegas late Christmas Eve and my flight wasn’t rebooked to get in Christmas Day. We didn’t panic because we thought we would have enough time to resolve this issue. However we got stuck on hold with Delta for 3.5 hours. By that time we decided this is a joke and if we’re going to beat holiday traffic Christmas Eve we better get going even if that meant we wouldn’t get to our destination until 3:00 am. We were already on vacation so we had to extend our rental another day and pay for gas in an SUV to get to Vegas. By the time we were an hour into our drive delta finally answered only to tell us that our flight was cancelled due to weather and that there was nothing they could do to make this situation right.

Champagne was closeted away, the sauce with the chicken was far too salty for my liking. Amenity kit which is touted is very basic does not have a comb, however in its defense it does contain a generic hand sanitizer in gel form however would have been better had this been Purell.

I went to D4 and the screen said Eugene Oregon. So, I updated my email and it said I was actually to leave from S16. I went to gate S16. There was nothing. I asked the concierge desk and they said flight from D4 had left. So I switched to the next flight to Spokane. Which was only a stand-by ticket. I figured since I had an hour, I’d check if D4 had actually left. It had not. They would not switch me back to my original flight from D4.

A very pleasant experience with Delta, check-in and bag drop at LAX was seamless, despite long lines for the security at terminal 2. However the boarding process was a bit hectic and it feels like Delta is trying to cram as many flights into the small terminal 2 at LAX. Flight services on the cross-continent flight are wonderful. Glad to see they've upgraded the personal entertainment system on the 767s into newer larger HD screens. It's the best flying across the country on a 767 since it's spacious and you don't have to pass 2 people to go out of your seat if you have a window seat. Really surprised that on this flight delta provided complimentary lunch for all classes (even economy!) The beef pastrami sandwich was so good it made into one of the best pastrami I've ever had! Food was well-plated and presented too, with a side salad and desserts. Delta also now provides free wifi for texting and messaging on all flights! This is a game changer!

"""business class old and outdated""",2017-11-03,5,K Sheares,"✅ Verified Review |  Munich to Tampa via Atlanta. First time I have flown Delta internationally as it is not an airline I typically fly or prefer. But due to an attractive airfare from Germany to Florida in business class I decided to give it a try. I was shocked about the age of the plane and the seating for business class. Both are old and outdated. I read Delta decided to keep its aging aircraft and not turn over for newer aircraft and clearly this route is one of those where the older planes are utilized. Their terminal location at the Munich airport is in keeping with their aircraft, old beat up, primitive and a lot of cattle herding before boarding the aircraft. Once onboard and into my seat I realized the business class seats were really out of date in both design and fittings. The video system failed and was unavailable for the flight which was a real drag for 9.4 hours. The provided headphones were cheap copies of Bose which in other airlines is a standard for business and first class. (Return flight I will be sure to download movies and bring my own headset.) The food service looked good but the chicken meal was so overcooked and the cooked spinach was filled with grit. The light meal served before landing in Atlanta was so salty I could not eat it either. So both meals were inedible and a good thing I had a solid breakfast before boarding the flight. Seat was comfortable but very tight unless one is 150 lbs and under 5'10"". A blanket and good size pillow was provided which helped. Bottled water was provided so one did not have to ring for the flight attendant for something to drink. Because of the configuration of the 767 the bathroom was behind business class and attached next to the food preparation area for coach passengers. This also meant sharing those bathrooms with coach passengers as well. Though I never had to wait for a free bathroom. Again, old plane with a older design compared to the new standards most airlines now have for their bread and butter business class passengers. OK for the much talked about service model that Delta staff employ for its business class passengers is true they do really try hard to be charming and helpful but I suspect it is to cover up all the Delta deficiencies has using these out of date aircraft. But in the end it did not help the fact the food was terrible, the video system did not work and the airport waiting, boarding process was much akin to a SouthWest experience.",Boeing 767-400,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Tampa via Atlanta,October 2017,no,2,3,1,0,3,3,3

Delta's Comfort + was the most comfortable I've been on in a long time for the price ($1100). That's at least $300 less then other airlines economy class running the Asia route vs Delta's premium Comfort plus. The staff was nice and accommodating, despite there being some confusion with Incheon crew, I think they were in training or new staff cause they seemed a bit nervous so minus a star there. Flight wise, food was above average in taste with 3 selections, not your mom's home cooking but satisfying. Best of all, the free Starbucks and Bailey's on the house and other drink selection was a fantastic touch. Free messaging wifi helped me kept in contact with those below and organize schedules. (Kakao Talk worked, even though it was not on the list of usable apps, so I think any messaging app is ok as long as you don't send pictures or files you're fine.) Delta also gave free face mask, ear plugs and ear phones. Movie infotainment system selection was great. Leg room was ample my knees didn't touch the back on the person in front at all even at front on a full recline, I'm 5'10"".

On the return trip we didn't get a seat when we checked in online. It said that the seat would be assigned at the gate. Which gate? I had no idea, because Delta doesn't bother to put it on the ticket. Anyway, a line started to form as the agent got to the gate. She gave the first person in line a seat, the next person a seat and then the third person in line a seat and told the rest of us to sit down unless we were will to give up our reservation for a voucher.

I called JustFly (the online ticketing agency) and Delta to request a refund for the return trip due to the fact that my son will not be in Florida due to the cancelled flight (if he is not in Florida, he cannot utilize a flight from Florida). Justfly said they needed some sort of waiver from Delta to process a cancellation and refund, Delta said that the flight was not affected by Harvey and therefore there will be no refund.

I can see having an issue if someone was just willy nilly changing their minds about traveling, sure charge me a change fee, but when you are physically unable to take a trip due to circumstances beyond your control (Harvey has closed down Texas), then the airline should consider the circumstances and provide a refund and cancellation without fees or penalties in hopes that the traveller would remember how gracious the airline had been and would make sure to fly that airline in the future.

In both directions, YYJ-SEA legs were served by SkyWest using CRJ-700 aircraft; SEA-ATL legs used B757 outbound and A321 for the return; ATL-DCA legs used A321s in both directions. For all legs, interior cabins were clean and modern (even the B757, a model that Boeing stopped manufacturing in 2003). A321s were brand-new, but nevertheless had the seating design problem of wasting several centimetres of available fuselage width owing to an unnecessary gap between the window-seat armrests and fuselage. A321s also had the new narrower washroom design. A pregnant or significantly overweight passenger would have difficulty turning around inside. Delta categorizes its passengers under many rubrics – Comfort Class, Comfort+ Class, Delta One Class, SkyPriority Class, Medallion Class, Premium Cabin, Main Cabin, and so on. The only clearly-named category I recognised was ""First Class"". I didn't think any of my flights had a ""First Class"", but, on one of my outbound flights, the gate agents nevertheless announced it as one of the groups for early boarding (even in advance of parents with small children and passengers using wheelchairs!). By the end of my trip, I discovered that my ""Comfort+ Class"" ticket was considered also to be in the ""Premium Cabin"" and ""SkyPriority Class"" categories, which all overlapped. A full set of definitions should have been provided as part of the ticket. IFE offered a decent selection of audio and video, but the categorisation made no sense: better to look for the full A-Z listing. For Comfort+ class, ""snacks"" were offered; but the only real food was a banana. Alcoholic beverages were supposed to be available without additional charge for Comfort+ passengers, but at no time did the FAs explicitly say so. Outbound, the ATL-DCA leg was cancelled, as were three other Delta flights that evening serving the same route. Delta apologised profusely, explaining that thunderstorms in the US northeast corridor had prevented flights from landing at DCA and mentioning air-traffic-control congestion as a contributing factor. Oddly, after I arrived in Washington the next day, friends told me they could recall no rain or thunderstorms in Washington the night before. Passengers on the cancelled flights were required to stay overnight at ATL at our own expense. Many passengers did their own rebooking of flights online. Only one Delta agent was present at the service counter near the gate to do rebooking in person. Nearby were Delta telephones where rebooking agents could be reached, but few people noticed them. For overnight lodging, Delta gave us a print-out saying that it had a ""negotiated rate"" with a nearby motor hotel, although it didn't make an outright recommendation. It was a seedy place, well worn and with visible damage to walls and fixtures. It is unwise for Delta to associate its name with that motor hotel. I had one G&T; on the ATL-SEA return leg.

Bad weather in ATL delayed us and, oddly, FLL agents boarded the flight, then unboarded, then immediately reboarded the airplane. While in the terminal waiting to reboard I asked a Redcoat to notify ATL of my close connection and asked for “meet and assist” help upon arrival. I watched him type in the request and listened as he read it to me. We arrived in ATL on an A gate with 24 minutes to spare – my AMS departure was leaving from an E gate. Of course, no one was there to assist and the one gate agent had his hands full with normal gate arrival activities. While running to the connections train I saw on a departures board that the AMS flight, which had been showing on-time on the Delta mobile app, was now delayed 30 minutes. Not sure what to believe I hustled to the E gate, where boarding had not even begun. I am disappointed because on this trip I needed help from Delta and got blown off.

Waiting around for nothing when we could have been told earlier and either went home or got a hotel and rebooked. Why wait until 1:30am. No compensation or credit or hotel to stay in nothing. Things happen, but to not be taken care of for nothing is a little absurd. Statistics show that if you stayed at a hotel and had an ok experience you would most likely not stay at that hotel. If you had a bad experience, but the staff took care of and made that experience right you would go back at a much higher rate.

I bought tickets three months in advance for my mother and I to attend my nephew's graduation assuming prices would start to rise after that. To my surprise, fares lowered dramatically a few weeks after my purchase. I had originally purchased ""Main Economy"" tickets, Delta's middle tier in economy. Upon seeing the new lower prices, I called Delta who offered to upgrade us to Delta Comfort+, their top tier in economy which offers more legroom, advance boarding and guaranteed overhead bin space. The ticket price of the upgraded seats was lower than what I had paid for Main Economy and Delta's response was to issue each of us the $49 fare difference in vouchers for future travel (which we will definitely use this year before expiry) even though they were under no obligation to do so. My mother requires wheelchair assistance and this was handled flawlessly on both ends of both flights. Both flights left slightly late but arrived on time on the outbound and early on the return. Outbound seat very uncomfortable, return was fine. We had ""bulkhead"" seats both ways on these regional flights and as there is no wall separating First and Economy we were able to stow belongings under the First seat in front of us avoiding the bulkhead inconvenience of having to stow everything in the overhead. Crew polite, helpful and professional on both flights. On the return crew pilfered First snacks in order to provide my mother with a nut and seed free option.

My wife and I booked through Virgin a return flight Manchester to Boston via New York. Besides the flight being cancelled from New York to Boston their staff were non existent. We arrived in New York delayed but with a time that was tight as you have to go through security and immigration. After panicking a little we found the flight was delayed. We set off to the boarding gate. I am disabled and require a mobility scooter to get around so I was waiting patiently for Delta member of staff to check us out as usual. This never happened. To cut a long story short the flight while we sat waiting was delayed four time was coming from two different Airports and then cancelled. We were directed by an announcement that we had to go to a certain area in the airport to ascertain what to do next. We arrived at the named area and there was a queue. After waiting for about thirty minutes a staff member came out and said that we should go to another area. This we did it was a long way to go we reached the area and again a queue - after about thirty minutes we got to the desk. I iterated to the staff member that we had been travelling for over 20 hours and I was very sore. The staff member asked my wife to go around the back to look at the screen. I was unable to and also never asked to. The staff member was showing my wife that we were entitled to a hotel because I was disabled. I find this distasteful as surely anyone delayed due to the airline failings were entitled. Anyway we asked how we should get there and produced a voucher for a taxi. We were then told how to get to the taxi stand. I asked about our bags as my medication was in there. We were told to go to another office which was baggage claim. On arriving there we asked about the bags and we were refused. We went to the taxi stand and tried to find the taxi company asking one of the drivers he was not easy to understand he said it was his taxi. I was put in the back by means of ramps and I only just got in. The taxi driver did not know where the hotel was my wife caught a glimpse of it and showed it to the driver. Arriving at the hotel he wanted another voucher for the return journey next day. We did not have one. We ordered a taxi through the hotel, as I could not go through that again costing $40. Arriving at JFK we proceeded to the gate and guess what another delay. I thought here we go again. At the new take off time an hour delay there was further discussion as to how they would handle my mobility scooter and after one member of staff who seemed to be the group leader refusing to load it as they had not been trained. After a long discussion I was allowed to go to the Aircraft doors and my scooter was taken away. My thoughts were I was never going to see it again. I was directed to a seat,which was difficult to get in due to my disability and then found my wife was seated elsewhere. We arrived at Boston and went to retrieve our cases and found they were not there. My wife thought she spotted them some way from the area and sure enough it was them.

I was very disappointed with Delta Airlines, I booked my ticket to Zimbabwe on January 28th, 2017 for a trip in May 2017. I purchased separately a Delta Comfort seat for an additional total of $418 because I knew the 16 hour non stop flight to and from ATL to JNB was long. This reservation was done over the phone since I needed the assistance of a Delta agent to book a ticket from JNB to HRE and from HRE to JNB. When it came to checking in 24 hours prior to my trip on the 1st of May, the online system would not let me check in online. I had to call a Delta agent to assist with checking in. After being on the phone for over an hour, the agent had to redo my reservation under a new record locator and confirmation number. According to this agent, the reason why it would not let me check in was because there was a Date of Birth mismatch. The agent assured me that my seating remained intact, and just the confirmation had changed. I was finally able to check in. When boarding at RIC airport, all of a sudden, the agent gave me a new seat number which was NOT the original seat number I reserved. When I arrived in ATL, my boarding pass wouldn't scan. I was supposed to board with the SKY priority zone, but could not. I was supposed to be on seat 31F which was a delta comfort seat. The agent told me that they were checking to see if my luggage had transferred to the flight. I thought that was an odd response. All of a sudden, I have a new boarding pass with a new seat number 53E and they just reassigned me with no notice or explanation. I located the seat thinking it was another Delta Comfort seat, but it my dismay, it was a basic economy class seat. I reported this mix up immediately to one of the stewardess. She got the agent that reassigned my seat. This agent claimed they did not have a record of my purchasing economy comfort seat, yet it was on the documentation that I presented to him. I insisted that I wanted my original seat back, but of course he was totally unwilling to help or do anything to look into it.He totally disregarded me and ignored everything i had to say and walked away.

I don't usually fly with Delta when I do fly, but there were several aspects to this trip which were disappointing. My wife and I went on a missions trip to Guatemala. Of the 16 of us, baggage was delayed for 5!! For one person, it was delayed for 2 days (out of a 7 day trip!). The Guatemalan baggage attendant did not provide a file reference number to us (which we needed for baggage charge reimbursement purposes), so I just completed an online letter to them explaining why I cannot complete their online form (wasting more of my time). Additionally, on the trip home, we actually happened to get upgraded to a ""comfort plus"" seat. The desk attendant told us it cost an extra $100 for these seats and we would get a complementary drink if we desired. The leg room was definitely better, but that was it.

I had a flight from Houston to New York scheduled for today, Monday the 13th, and have been calling to adjust my flight due to the storm since Friday. I was told numerous times that my flight would not be affected by this storm and that in order to change my flight I would need to pay a change fee and the difference. This is completely unacceptable when you have customers being proactive and willing to take earlier flights. I was more than willing to pay the difference in the flight, but no fee waiver was offered.

Noticed that wine is now served from a full bottle, which is a nice upgrade. The B757, while an oldie, had a completely new cabin with in-seat power, personal TV screen, and wifi. The wifi didn't work well on all four segments of my trip.

"""consider flying with Delta again""",2017-02-24,8,J Choo,"✅ Verified Review |  New York to Buffalo return. On both flights, check-in and luggage drop-off at the airports were a breeze with hardly any need to queue. Several check-in desks were available. On my return flight, I reached the airport about 1.5 hours to departure and again, there was no need to queue. There were many kiosks available for self check-ins. Baggage drop-off and counter check-ins all took place at the counters. I appreciated the ease of joining a single queue that handled both check-in and baggage drop-off. The customer service person attended to my check-in baggage, tagged it, and brought it straight to the conveyor belt behind the counter, all in one station. This was so much easier compared to another US airline I flew with last year, also out from JFK, where I had to join 3 separate queues at 3 separate stations: one for check-in, then another one to have my luggage weighed and tagged, and a third station to drop off my baggage. The areas surrounding these 3 stations were, needless to say, crowded. chaotic and messy. For the passengers, I cannot imagine it being a superior experience than having one station that handles everything from check-ins to luggage drop-off. Boarding for both flights were orderly and according to frequent flyer status, premium or economy seats and zones. The planes were small and did not have a lot of storage space was available but the airline allows passengers to place their larger hand carry bags at the aero bridge prior to boarding which were then brought by handlers to be loaded in the cargo hold. On the out-going flight, free pretzels, cookies or peanuts were offered to passengers in economy with free drinking water. On the return flight, there were free pretzels or cookies with free water, tea, coffee and I believe soft drinks too. The captains made announcements at the beginning of each flight on the traffic at the airport and the expected take off time. The outgoing flight was on time but the return flight experienced a 20 mins delays. Passengers were able to access entertainment programmes like movies, sticoms, etc, through their own devices by logging into Delta Studio using the wifi onboard. The access to the entertainment programme which had a good selection of American and foreign movies is free. This was my first short haul experience with Delta.

It's for the gate agent. The lady working the gate in Atlanta at B29 on 2/23 for the flight to Charlotte at 3:10pm needs some serious lessons in customer service. I understand they have policies and protocols but there's really no need to be blatantly rude to your customers about it. I fly almost weekly with a carry on (that I'm almost always forced to check at the gate), my computer bag and a small purse. The purse can fit inside the computer bag but I wear it as a cross body and just slide it in the computer bag when I get to my seat. As I am walking into the tarmac she makes me stop and consolidate my tiny purse into my laptop bag. After a quick argument saying that it'll fit, I fly with this all the time she forces me to step aside, so I did and then I backed up to be out of the way and she proceeds to yell at me for where I choose to stand and then essentially makes fun of me to the next passenger boarding saying that I clearly didn't understand her the first ten times she said it. For the record, I heard her and I know the rules. I fly enough with the same 3 items and I'm never given a hard time about it. So if she enforces her rules more than others, bravo to a job well done but at least do it with some finesse and class. She's just rude and unprofessional. This is Delta, not a low class airline. The best part was, after I consolidated, they forced me to check my carry on anyways. She could have suggested that from the getgo instead of making a spectacle of me.

However, from the beginning, I had bad experiences, at the check in desk two ladies refused to let me board saying that I do not have a valid visa to travel to France even though I produce them my Danish resident permit which is valid for all Schengen states. They simply gave my passport back saying that I cannot travel to France without a valid visa. (I am a Sri Lankan passport holder with a Danish resident permit). I had to speak to their supervisor, and he issued the boarding passes to only to Paris. Enquired him about the boarding pass from Paris to Copenhagen, he said I can get it from the machine once I arrived in Paris. When I arrived in Paris I tried to print my boarding pass, but I was not able to print it due to the fact that they find my flight reservation CDG to CPH. I had to rush to Air France customer service, and they said Delta has not issued my ticket from CDG to CPH while rescheduling my ticket.

On our return journey 10/01/17, our flight was delayed again and we were not sure if we had missed the connecting flight to London Heathrow as again we were not given any information. We were very anxious about missing the flight again, and we left our camera on the aircraft. We were in a queue for immigration for two hours - no information was forthcoming despite repeated requests for information as it was likely we could be re-booked for the 09.37 flight later that evening. We were told by one of the border agents that if we did not like waiting that we should not visit the United States. We then arrived at re-booking and had to wait a further 30 minutes to be told that we had been booked on the next flight which was leaving in 5 minutes and that we should run to the boarding gates. We pushed our way through the security ran all the way to the shuttle train, down corridors and up escalators and got to the gate to be told the flight had gone and there was nothing they could do. We were given a voucher to stay at the Ramada Plaza hotel. We did not have any hand luggage as this was checked on the flight but we were told we could collect an overnight pack. The queue for this appeared a further 30 minute wait so we headed off to the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to queue for a further 30 minutes before being allocated a room for the night. We were told that food vouchers could not be provided as this should have been given by the staff at the airport. We order some food which arrived at 1.00 am in the morning which we paid for using our visa card. As a result of the delays my husband has had to take a day's leave due to the delays.",None,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to PUJ via ATL,January 2017,no,1,2,1,1,1,1,1

The flight from DFW to ATL boarded on time, the staff was very friendly with everyone. We got drink and snacks. Once we arrived at Atlanta I had to transfer to the international gates.

"""not expect to be left high and dry""",2017-01-11,2,Anthony Mazzuca,"✅ Verified Review |  I am currently in Day 4 of a 13 day trip to Ukraine. My bags were checked on Sunday in PHL to JFK then to AMS (KLM) and to KBP (KLM - Ukraine International Airlines) but have still not appeared in Ukraine. I am getting no reasonable assistance from Delta Air Lines to assist me in locating my bags and making sure they get to me in Ukraine. The level 1 and 2 agents in Customer Service and baggage are refusing to own this situation, and pretty much just reading back to me what is on the Delta website. I am now resorting to Social media so hopefully someone outside of the @Delta customer service organization sees this and will reach out to me to assist. I am so dissapointed with the customer experience on this issue.

"""this is a terrible airline""",2017-01-09,1,M Laselle,"✅ Verified Review |  Memphis to Atlanta. This is a terrible airline if I am being completely honest. I have been rebooked 3 times, I have waited in the airport for over 9 hours for my flight to be rebooked due to weather. Because of weather they do not put you up in a hotel, so I have paid for my own hotel for 2 nights now.  No other airline has delays or cancellations in the country either, other airlines are going to the same places that I am and are still going.",None,Solo Leisure,First Class,MEM to ATL,January 2017,no,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
"""lack of ability to rebook a flight""",2017-01-09,3,N Thallen,"✅ Verified Review |  Fayetteville to Stuttgart via Atlanta. I have used Delta Air Lines on countless occasion, flying over 100,000 miles on military orders easy. This may be the last time. Don't get me wrong, it takes a lot to make me care enough to write a review. The service from the flight attendants is typically very attentive and they do what they can to accommodate you. The entertainment has a wide selection of movies, music etc. (when the screens are actually operational) and the seats are not unbearable. My issue is with the airlines lack of accommodation when they have a failure to notify the individual that their flight was cancelled and lack of ability to rebook a flight that is equivalent to the one that was paid for. By missing my flight and not being able to reach the deadlines that are required makes me look unprofessional and weighs heavy on my position. This flight definitely put a bad taste in my mouth in regards to Delta Air Lines, unfortunately there was not any attempt to reconcile the issue.",None,Business,Economy Class,FAY to STR via ATL,January 2017,no,3,4,3,3,1,2,3

The IFE is nice but movie selection and variety I have experienced better. In the aircraft's we have flown there were no power sockets. Attendants not the most courteous I have seen.

"""outshines their SkyTeam partners""",2017-01-05,9,Tom Matava,"✅ Verified Review |  Stuttgart to Atlanta. Delta Air Lines messaged early morning about a flight delay which was appreciated. Flight had been oversold and when checking in online I was offered the opportunity to volunteer. Flight was completely full including a large bulldog used as a ""comfort dog."" Cabin crew was somewhat senior but gracious, in the aisles to assist passengers as they boarded. Service began quickly and the welcoming attitudes continued with flight attendants engaging with passengers as services were offered. While there is nothing specific to tag as having made the flight good, it just was. Everything - food, entertainment, staff availability, even the seat - was comfortable.

"""there were so many empty seats""",2017-01-05,1,A Koga,"✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I flew Delta Air Lines from HNL to NRT. We booked on Expedia and a day before the flight we got an email reminder showing our seats, etc. We had booked our seats so we were sitting together. Unfortunately, when we got to the airport, we found ourselves sitting in middle seats in different rows. I explained that my wife was pregnant with morning sickness and it would be great if they could at least switch her to a seat in the aisle. But both the girl at check-in and the guy at the gate said they had no seats for us to change to and that we couldn't upgrade. ""Fine,"" I thought, ""sucks for us, but if they have a full plane then there's nothing they can do about it."" The really upsetting thing is that after boarding we saw that there were many seats open just a few rows in front and behind us. Luckily there was a couple sitting next to us that had been similarly split up and we ended up switching with them so we could both sit with our spouses. I don't know what the deal with Delta seat selection is, but given that they couldn't even accommodate my pregnant wife when there were so many empty seats made this our last Delta flight ever. P.S. I found crumbs on my tray table from the previous flight. Also, the touch screen for my entertainment was broken (It responded to about 1 out of every 10 times I touched it).",None,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,HNL to NRT,January 2017,no,1,2,4,1,1,2,1
"""maintenance standards and competencies""",2017-01-04,1,R Sanyal,"✅ Verified Review |  Milwaukee to Calgary via Minneapolis. Three of the four flights were inordinately delayed, not because of weather which I would have understood given the season, but because of mechanical problems. The departure time from Milwaukee was constantly pushed back -- to an extent that we missed the connecting flight at Minneapolis. I was assured when the first delay was announced that we would make the connection with the new timing. This happened a second time. We were willing to cancel our tickets and take flights on alternative airlines. But the gate agents were not able to be honest about the actual departure time -- in fact, they said they were only the messengers of the news. In the event, we lost the entire day travelling and reached our destination so late that we had to arrange for alternative transportation because we had missed our previously booked non-refundable transfers -- not to mention the holiday activities we had planned that afternoon and evening. It started our holiday on a very bad note. On the return, early morning flight was delayed for mechanical reasons. However we reached Minneapolis in time to connect. But the connecting flight after travelling down the runaway, gathering speed, suddenly braked and returned to the gate - mechanical problems. An alternative plane was arranged and we reached home several hours later. The ground manager asked us to rate them high for having arranged a replacement plane -- what gall! When you have 3 out of 4 flights on the same type of aircraft of the same airline experience mechanical problems, we have to be very concerned about the maintenance standards and competencies at Delta Airlines. Unfortunately, on many routes we have to put up with this airline as there are no alternatives.",CRJ,Family Leisure,First Class,MKE to YYC via MSP,December 2016,no,2,3,2,0,1,0,1

But, moved to the west coast and due to lack of direct flights to some cities from OAK, I have not flew Delta in recent years. I flew from ICN to SFO today after two flights with Asian airlines. What a difference. Delta's seat were so hard, I thought I was setting on the granite. Cold, old and hard! Food was awful. Service, I can't understand why people pay their money to fly Delta.

"""made the start of 2017""",2017-01-04,10,Christina Orlowski,"✅ Verified Review |  I wanted to take the time to recognize the Delta Staff that helped in making the start of my vacation an absolute dream! As a Stage 4 Breast Cancer patient they literally made the start of 2017, a start I will not forget! On January 2nd my friends and I were set to board a Delta flight from Chicago to Paris where we had a layover before getting to Dublin. I made Delta aware two months prior that I needed an accommodation made to have a seat in Bulk as I had just finished chemo in September and my oncologist wanted me up moving and stretching throughout the flight. Unfortunately, upon arriving to check in, I noticed that this hadn't been done, but explained my situation to them and they kindly placed me in an appropriate seat.  Prior to boarding my name was called and they had decided to move me into business class. In addition when they found out I was flying with friends they moved their seats up to premium economy, so that I would be able to easily be able to walk up and down the aisles and talk with them. Throughout the flight the staff checked on me and my friends as well. Delta Airlines has a Breast Cancer Research Foundation and  this is the first time that I've actually seen a company represent the Pink Ribbon so well! The staff didn't have to care about my situation or consider my friends in the mix, but they did and the fact that they made this flight what it was to me, means absolutely everything!",None,Solo Leisure,Business Class,ORD to CDG,January 2017,yes,5,5,5,5,5,0,5
"""late departure was Delta's fault""",2017-01-02,4,W Pollitt,"✅ Verified Review |  Minneapolis to Guangzhou via Detroit and Beijing, returning from Beijing via Detroit. Departing flight was fine, Delta spend a few more bucks for better food, refreshments, and bottled water was generously given out. This made a 13 hour flight more pleasant. The downside was the arrival at Guangzhou on a China Southern Airlines domestic flight, had to depart plane only to get herded into a stand up bus, then to door to get luggage. It was hot, and after a 26 hour flight time makes one grumpy. Return was fair, food was fair. Real downside was a delayed departure from Beijing to Detroit and then boarding the plane in Detroit to Minneapolis to be treated rudely by attendant for being late after I practically ran from getting my luggage to go through customs then to the boarding gate. The late departure was Delta's fault, faulty equipment.
