"""professional and personable""",2016-11-07,8,L Choi,"✅ Verified Review |  Our family of four flew from Toronto to Philadelphia via Detroit in Nov 2016, and back again on the same segments. I believe it is the first time we've flown Delta, and we were impressed despite a few hiccups: In general the staff were professional and personable, there seemed to be a real priority on leaving/arriving on time, ground services were able to move passengers onto the plane in good time despite the challenges. Appreciated the free onboard movies and being able to download the gogo app real-time to play the movie, did not use Wi-Fi for Internet access. We got a super deal for this fare. Toronto to Detroit a smaller plane - we were all seated apart from each other, which was not optimal but we knew check-in seat assignment was a condition of the fare we purchased (just didn't realize it could be at the gate) - apparently our names were called at the gate but we did not hear the announcement, and by the time we got to the desk, these were the best seats we could get - one of my children is 10 years old, so I think the system should aim to seat a parent with a child that age or younger - seat assignments at the gate are a bit frustrating, you're in 1 line with a mix of customer issues which take a little to a lot of time to resolve - I stood in line for about 15 minutes only to be told that I would have to wait until my name was called - I was seated in a window seat, in row of two seats. When an obese passenger sat down beside me, I felt very squished (the passenger took ~ 1.5 seats) and I knew (being somewhat claustrophobic) that flying for an hour would not be a tolerable situation - I requested and was granted a seat change to a spare seat so that issue was resolved. However, I think Delta should have given this passenger two seats, it was unfair for both of us, and I'm not sure how the issue would have been resolved had there not been a spare empty seat. - flight was smooth and on time - we were very impressed Detroit to Philly - larger plane, we were able to check-in online and get these seat assignments then, we were all seated together, flight was on time - the landing was a bit hard.  Return from Philly to Detroit we were unable to check-in online for some reason, and the error message said we should speak with a Special Services agent at the airport for check-in. It was strange, unlike the online check-in process Toronto-Philly, where I was able to check all four of us in, this time the system separated the two adults, and each child into a separate party - ie. we received three email notifications to check-in separately (which didn't work and we could not check-in online) - we had to speak with a Special Services agent, who was able to seat two of us together (adjacent aisle seats) and the other two in separate areas of the plane. Flight was smooth and on time, they were overbooked (probably due to the previous flight issue) but this issue was resolved. Detroit to Toronto there wasn't enough room to accommodate everyone at the gate area (I believe a previous flight had been cancelled) -the gate was small, seemed more like a hallway. The agent in Philly was able to seat 3 of us, we had to get 1 seat assigned at the gate - flight was delayed because there was a problem closing the cargo door - other than that the flight was smooth, great landing.",None,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to PHL via DTW,November 2016,yes,4,4,3,5,4,4,5

The pitch was average in the 31-32 inches and seats ok for economy. What came as a very good surprise was the meal and beverage service. We had a choice of 3 different dinners (one being vegetarian) and they came with an entrée, salad, cheese and dessert. We had a mid-flight snack in a small box and a pre-arrival sandwich. We also had ice cream. Beverages were served often and each was given a bottle of water. Coffee was good and wine and beer was complimentary. I beleive this was of my best economy class flights ever, better than Air France for sure. On the outbound flight, I had seat 10c on the Detroit-Amsterdam in an A330. Great legroom and worth the money. The ticket cost me €460 return and that inlcudes Comfort class from DTW to Amsterdam @ €89 one way.

Flew from Los Angeles to Atlanta. I get to the Delta terminal at LA after a somewhat 11-hour flight, the self-check-in was easy and the staff were helpful, I dropped the baggage, the lady serving the counter was really helpful and the baggage drop itself was efficient. I went through TSA and into the terminal. The Delta terminal at LA would be an insult to 3rd world airports because there is absolutely nothing going on there. Unlike the competing American carrier's terminal where there is always music playing and all duty-free on one side, and all planes on the other so passengers can watch planes come and go, it kind of already made me hate the airline. The boarding was pretty efficient, and the cabin crew was the highlight of the experience. This was a red eye flight, and despite that the FA's kept making rounds of the cabin offering water, drinks, and snacks. In addition to that, they went out of their way to shuffle baggage in the cabin to make space without having to check them in.

I must say the crew did an excellent job dealing with all the issues. But I am very disappointed with Delta Air Lines. ATL is a major Delta hub, so how  they don't have an extra plane in case of an emergency?! Also the fact that we were kept 3.5 hours on termac was awful! It is inhuman to keep people on the plane while trying to fix it. The fumes that eventually leaked from flooded engine were suffocating us, all while we were told to hang on tight and wait until they figure out if the pump works. I know I do not spend time in my car while mechanic is working on it, so why the passengers had to stay on the plane while having mechanical issues.

"""just terrible and unacceptable""",2016-08-02,1,John Kilgore,"Miami to Los Angeles. Started off with a late departure from Miami, headed to LA. Flight information indicated an LA arrival of 10:20 pm, versus the originally booked ETA of 9:50 pm. No big deal. But, the way they staff handled boarding was so disorganized that we left much later than the (already delayed) ETD of 7:40 pm. It was like herding cats with many people being left with no overhead storage space. I was fortunate to have boarded with zone 2, but it was incredible how many carry bags and back packs that could easily fit under the seat in front of passengers wound up in the overhead. Thus, quite a long delay doing last second checking of bags. The pilot made up time and it was proudly announced we had landed in LA at 10:04 pm, roughly 10 minutes later than the original schedule. But, then we sat on the runway for two hours before finding a gate at the Tom Bradley International terminal. So, it appears our flight was sacrificed to avoid backing up other flights. We exited into the terminal (after midnight) to find (literally) wall-to-wall people waiting on flights. A serious mess. Then the long walk with our bags to get to a domestic terminal to pick-up our shuttle. When we were getting ready to exit the plane, the pilot came over the PA with a less than sincere, meaningless apology. This airline is horrible! The consequences for me were that I got home 3 hours later than I should have, after 1 am. But, other people on my flight had serious connection issues. Just terrible and unacceptable.

Not only that but when I arrived at the gate in Minneapolis they closed it 20 minutes prior to departure (the cut off time is 10 minutes) and forbade us to get on board. I'm pretty sure they ovebooked that flight and gave away our seats or sold them.

I had to spent one night in Minneapolis and the next day they flew us to Salt Lake City where I had to spend 8 hours in the airport; the flight to Europe was delayed again 3.5 hours so by the time I arrived in Europe I missed my connection again so they rebooked me on a flight to Paris from Amsterdam. That plane too left one hour later than scheduled and my final plane had another hour delay to my final destination to Bucharest. All in all I had to change 5 planes and it took me 2 days and 4 hours to get to Bucharest from Las Vegas traveling with 3 minor children and a 72 years old.

There were eight people on our booking, however two of the boarding passes had not printed correctly, with the barcodes only printing halfway. As such, the boarding pass was unable to be scanned, and we were told to print out new boarding passes. We ran back down to the ticketing counter, had our boarding passes reprinted by an actual employee of Delta Airlines (not at the kiosk), and went back to TSA, only to find that this new boarding pass would not scan either. Again, we had our boarding passes reprinted once more, and again, it would not scan. The TSA officer stated that the issue was that there was no “destination” stated on the new boarding passes. We then had to go back downstairs to the ticketing counter, retrieve our original boarding pass with the faulty barcode, and bring them all back up to TSA. Only then were we allowed to pass through airport security. We reached the gate 4 minutes late, and were not allowed to board, even though the cabin doors had not been closed. During this time, our friends who had successfully passed airport security had been explaining to Delta Airlines employees at the gate, however they received no help from them. The Delta employee at the gate stated that all he could do was put us on a waiting list on the next Delta Airlines flight, which was already full, and that we should contact other airlines for a new flight.

We booked our trip in First Class as we consider coast to coast a long haul flight, and we like our comfort. Firstly, 4/4 flights were delayed. Delays due to weather, to not having a gate ready to disembark passengers, to long lines waiting to take off, to a faulty fuel cap, to missing paperwork, to delayed arrival of connecting aircraft, etc. Second, the seats in first class are hard as rocks, as well as cramped and narrow with insufficient recline.

On the positive side they seem to be pretty consistently on time, or close enough. I've had tight connections in hubs and never a problem, even though I've had to sprint on occasion. SLC is best, then MSP, DTW. ATL is spotty, LAX is definitely a problem spot. The cabin crew is far, far better on the whole than United. Much more professional and caring, usually well put together. While it's impossible to use miles (like all carriers it seems), they offer decent perks for status. On the negative side, they change their schedule all the time. Like, weekly, but tend to firm up about 10 days out (so more planning than execution). It can be problematic when your tickets come from a company travel service, since you'll need to go through them to re-accommodate. Skyteam coordination is hit-and-miss.

"""cabin crew were efficient""",2016-07-02,8,L Barallat,"Travelled recently on Delta to Paris CDG, opting for the EWR flight as the time was more convenient than the earlier departure from JFK (I was using Delta Sky Miles for this segment). The Delta ""rotunda"" at EWR is actually a near-pleasant experience. For one, the departure time, just after 9pm, means its the last Delta departure out of EWR for the day and the entire security experience to gate was hassle free. The Amsterdam flight departs much earlier, at 6.30pm. The boarding area is standard Delta fare. There is a small Duty Free shop, some relatively tidy bathrooms, and one sports bar in the long corridor that leads to the gates. Boarding was chaotic (flight was full) and plenty of additional passport checks were conducted at the gate. Flight push back was delayed 35-40 minutes due to a Sofia bound passenger that didn't board, and the luggage had to be removed from the hold. The plane was a 1991-build 767-300ER, which once flew for Gulf Air. Delta has done a nice job of renovating the interiors and even Economy Class was decent. AVOD was great as was the USB port to charge your phone. Meal service was nothing spectacular, but did the job for what is a 6 hour 30 minute flight. Cabin crew were efficient, relatively friendly.

I was a little upset, but despite his terrible communication and people skills, if it's full, it's full. So I board the plane and go near my seat and sure enough, there's at least three or four places where my bag would easily fit. I tell a flight attendant right away and they tell me that the checked bags have already been stored underneath, so I can't go get it.  Why would he say that?

Going to customer service was futile, the desk clerk literally told her supervisor she would not handle delayed flight cases. We got rebooked to a connection in Minneapolis, which Delta also cancelled. It took a further 2 hours waiting in a customer service line to get a solution. The customer service personnel proved absolutely useless, actually handing us a card to their 800 line because they were overwhelmed. The call also proved frustrating, it was only after thirty minutes of being put on hold and talking to an agent that we managed to get a connection to JFK the following morning.

On time departure is calculated from pull back from gate, even if you go only a few feet. Service on board both sectors was excellent with very pleasant and efficient crew.

The lounge at JFK was welcoming and had a variety of hot and cold food on offer. Having eaten on the plane we did not bother with the offerings in the lounge. There is a complimentary bar service (you pay for premium and imported) with a good range of beverages supplemented by tea/coffee machines.

"""frustrated and exhausted""",2016-06-17,2,Stephen Blaskowski,"I just spent 12 hours on airplanes and in airports traveling from DCA to SFO and very few of them were pleasant. It started with a delayed flight that would have caused me to miss my connecting flight. I did receive email notice, but the itinerary was not rebooked. I went to do it myself but was unsure whether or not I could make the earlier flight and so I decided to wait to resolve the issue at the airport customer service desk. Apparently that was my fatal mistake. I arrived at the airport a good hour before the earlier flight's scheduled departure and proceeded to stand in line for half an hour at the desk while 1 customer service rep was struggling to manage a growing line. By the time the other representatives who had been walking in and out of the back room finally jumped in to help, I had tried and failed to rebook myself both online and on the phone, where the estimated wait time was 34 minutes. The representative rebooked me on the remaining itinerary available which was several hours later. After security I then stood in another customer service line for nearly an hour to receive my seat assignment. This flight was also significantly delayed, and even after boarding, we then sat on the tarmac for another hour because of first ""congestion on the runway"" and then ""inclement weather"". I also was asked to check my carry on due to space limitations, and when I protested explaining that I had an interview the next morning and my suit was in my carry on and I didn't want to risk the luggage being lost, the representative literally pulled my ticket out of my shirt pocket to check my name. We were all frazzled, but this really took me aback. By an act of God, my new layover was several hours and the gate happened to be right next to our arrival gate so I made the connection despite the two hour delay (on top of the delay from my original booking). This second flight was also slightly delayed and again I was asked to check my carry on. This time I relented after the representative offered that I remove my garment bag and she would hang it in first class. This rep is the only reason I'm giving a rating above the absolute minimum. Once we arrived in SFO the cherry on top is that we were forced to sit on the tarmac for another half an hour waiting for the arrival gate to open up. I'm not trying to be petty. I'm just legitimately frustrated and exhausted. Customers pay a lot of money for these flights. They don't have to be this painful and they shouldn't be.

Pre-Boarding in MUC I was surprised by the captain stepping outside the plane and anouncing the flight infront of the whole B-Gates. Crew was nice and welcoming. I preordered veggie food and tasted like it was bought at a Wholefoods market. I have seen better Entertainment Systems with a wider selection of movies and TV shows, but it worked out fine for me and was easy to use. Atlanta serves as the biggest Delta Hub and makes it quite easy to transfer. It is the busiest airport in the world, though, so short connections are usually not reached. ATL to CVG was on a MD88, not the newest aircraft but clean and on time. It was full, so some passengers were offered to check their bags during boarding for free. Onboard service like any other domestic airline, but onboard WiFi seemed to have worked good. When I came to the baggage claim at CVG, my bags were already there, waiting for me. My flight back to MUC was from PHL on the new connection via DTW. Flight from PHL to DTW was on a Boeing 717-200 and delayed by 2 hours due to heavy thunderstorms in PHL and temporary airport closure during that time. Not Deltas fault and they seemed to do everything they could to rebook passengers with tight connections at DTW. Aircraft used was small and again packed full. Again basic service. DTW serves as Deltas second largest hub and is easy to get around since domestic and international Gates from Delta and partners are just across the hall. DTW-MUC again on an old B767-400ER, but with flawless service and nice selection of beers and wines even in Economy Basic.

The gate agent did not thank me in any way for being a gold elite frequent flyer in DL's program, and did not smile (the least she could do, given that there's no first class to upgrade into). My exit row seat (8D) had less legroom than regular non-exit rows on mainline aircraft. Extremely bumpy flight throughout. Bathroom at the back of the aircraft is incredibly tiny. My feet were freezing by the end of the one and a half hour long flight, because of the very cold airflow by the floor in the exit row (not sure if this was a specific issue with this particular A/C, or a problem with the CRJ200 in general). The pricing on this route does not make any sense (I paid as much for a coach one-way Detroit-Greensboro in coach as I do for roundtrip nonstops Detroit - Las Vegas in first class), lack of competition or high demand, perhaps.

I do prefer Delta to other US airlines, however. Flew Detroit to Shanghai. The leather seats are pretty nice, as they feel less dirty than the fabric seats can potentially be. The inflight entertainment had a pretty good selection, but the setup of the system was not the most convenient. In the economy cabin, you plug your headphones into the system itself rather than the armrest, thus if you need to let a passenger leave his seat, you have to unplug your headphones for him to do so. The food in economy class was just what you would expect of airplane food, nothing special. When boarding the plane, the cabin was disgustingly heated, as the air conditioning was not working very well on the ground. The air conditioning did work while in the air, however.

The seat and private space was smaller than I am used to from flying with AA, but it is also a smaller aircraft. The seat offered a full recline, duvet and pillow. I found the seat fairly comfortable and although there was a massage function, it wasn't very effective. I also found there to be very little space to store anything small in the seat. Additional there was no call button for the crew. I was provided an amenity kit which was a very nice Tumi case. After settling in I was offered a drink.

I called Delta on 3 different days and was hung up on, transferred, put on hold, and hung up again on multiple times. The third day, I finally got a hold of a real person and told her my predicament.  She said ""That did not occur. That confirmation number you gave me doesn't exist. You'll have to apply for a refund through the website and then it will be up to the auditor's discretion whether or not you receive a refund."" I said, ""But now it's been 8 days, so the auditor will refuse to refund me. I cancelled it within 24 hours - in fact, within one hour - and received confirmation that I did. Are you seriously telling me that whoever I spoke to 8 days ago was just making stuff up and now I'm just out $1200 for no reason?"" She was condescending and cruel, cutting me off. Her official response was that what I was saying never happened and there was nothing anyone could do. All I could do was apply for a refund and the rest was up to the auditor.

As we were flying out from Charlotte to our connecting flight in Detroit, we realized that we only had, what we thought, was a 38 minute layover to make it to our next flight out of Detroit.

As I ran ahead and sprinted to the gate to try and save my family and I some grief, I was greeted by a Delta representative who proceeded to inform me that I was to late to get on the flight, even though I could physically see our plane sitting in the loading spot, motionless. So, my family, along with around 15 other people who experienced the same I convienemt timing and planning due to Delta, watched the flight we had payed for depart in front of us. To try to salvage this situation, the crowd of left behind passengers began to congregate to the airlines help kiosk, where we virtually on went to be told that we needed to call and contact a Delta representative about changing flights - even though there was a representative standing right in front of us. To make things even better, once we had finally jumped through enough hoops and made it onto our flight from Detroit to Las Vegas (6 hours later), we were surprised to find out that not only did any of our luggage make it to Las Vegas, but they were sent on a flight that departed 3 hours after we were scheduled to land.
