I ended up having to file a claim and Delta is asking for receipts of all my stuff in the bag-which is ridiculous because how do they expect me to have receipts for items purchased years ago? Did I ask for my bag to be lost? The claims manager never answers his phone or returns messages. This is so unacceptable and I’ve had enough of this nonsense. I paid so much for my ticket-not to mention all my valuables inside the suitcase which Delta compensate me for. I need my bag back and Delta at this point feels they can be careless and pay me off (which they cannot because they would give me way less than what everything costs) and get away with it.

"""bad ground and customer service""",2019-10-26,1,S Tan,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delta repeatedly has bad ground and customer service staff. The breaking point which compelled me to write a feedback on this airline after flying with them for so many years came when they did not handle my luggage professionally. When there was damages found on the bags, the ground agents denied liabilities and accuse the fault was on passengers. The same was true to other passengers who experienced the same problem on the same flight when in Singapore from the US via Tokyo. After filing complaint to the customer service, the customer service took more than 14 days to reply (when in their auto reply email stated they would reply within 14 days) and the customer service would defend their mistakes and continue laying blame on the passengers. I have been their top level frequent fliers but I never felt I was treated like one at all. They don't offer any preferential check in, retrieval of luggage bags above their usual sky priority which a simple comfort + would earn the similar treatment while being the top frequent fliers on other alliance group or airlines would have offered 1st class service than Delta offering merely the same like comfort +. Service recovery is bad. The staff are not trained or geared towards high value customers at all. Having a Porsche for tight connection is nothing premium when other airlines offer direct boarding from lounge like Emirates or complimentary limousine airport transfers such as from JL, MH and so on. They appear to prefer paid business class passengers but their products and services completely do NOT match up to any full service airlines that have business class product. Their lounge is always filled with so many people and refreshment are really just plain refreshment (basic snacks NOT food) and very often, their lounges do NOT even have shower facilities. So don't even count on having complimentary spa/massage/sleeping area etc. Their planes are dirty and old yet the ticket fares are expensive. Amenities frequently not working for example IFE doesn't work, USB not charging, food stuck in between seats, chewing gums found in aircraft safety menu, dirty toilets, broken window shades and Delta has a policy where instead of bumping revenue passengers to higher classes when seats are needed, they would instead bump their non revenue employees or families/kins onto business class seats especially on international route. Their complimentary first class upgrade almost hardly happen to any members as it will always be full. Delta will always try not to offer the upgrade until at boarding and by which time, all the first class seats would be taken up already. So don't be fooled by the benefits stated on their website for their frequent fliers programme. Their hidden clause to defend their misrepresentation would be ""whenever available"". To Delta, available for revenue tickets doesn't mean available for upgrade. There is absolutely no incentives being their frequent fliers especially for international travellers. They are just a commuter airline within US or regional at best. So Delta best if ever rated best is best within the US only. In one word to describe Delta and by International Standard, avoid  it.

The flight left on time and as it departed late afternoon, I got to eat a meal on Delta and it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. It was average quality airline food. The IFE was reasonable for a domestic route. The typical reviews I read of US-based airlines mention how terrible the flight attendants are. However, the flight crew on this flight was professional and courteous. So, I thought I was fortunate to get a good crew. Upon reading little more on the US based airlines, it seems Delta has a better operation and more motivated workforce than American or United. Well, I hope they keep improving as all of them have a long way to go to compete effectively with many of the Middle Eastern and Asian airlines. If it wasn't for the US government protecting the domestic market for these carriers from their overseas competitors, they would have stopped operating long time before they went through their multi-year bankruptcy.

I have tried calling the corporate line 3 times and no answer. I sent them a complaint requesting a call back, nothing. So now I’ll share my experience with everyone I can. Our flight returning home from Hawaii was delayed 5 hours by the time we took off. It didn’t leave until after 2am when all was said and done. We had no where to go as everything closes early in Kauai, extra expenses related to rental car late return, had more expenses due to staying longer (food), had to try to make arrangements for kids that were supposed to be dropped off at our house by a certain time, and most importantly wasted my time and caused a lot of unneeded stress. I think of experiences I have had with companies in the past and this one far surpasses any negative experience I have had in the past. I called when we realized it was delayed, which was further delayed once more. I got a CS person that really was not helpful at all. They offered $100 for my troubles. I asked for a manager and he told me that is all they could do. Got the manager and she mentioned they might be able to do a bit more and never recorded the call or offer. I was so frustrated that my friends I was traveling with decided to call as I was getting really frustrated. My screen did not work on the way to Hawaii. My wife’s screen did not work on the way back. I cannot believe the lack of customer support. Any business I can think of that I have had a negative experience with has tried to rectify the negative experience. I feel you have to beg for help with Delta. I personally feel Delta does not care about its customers. A follow up call or apology coming from Delta would have been highly appropriate.

"""told there would be no refund""",2019-09-13,1,M Dehmer,"Not Verified |  About a week ago I decided to book a one-way flight with Delta out of Bismark to Minneapolis. Unfortunately, they were one of two airlines flying from there. Everything was going well and I purchased my ticket with a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee."" What is very misleading about this is that the airline does not specify which 24 hours these are. You can only get a refund within 24 hours of purchasing the ticket, not before the flight takes place. So with this assumption that the flight could be canceled and refunded as long as there was a 24 hour in advance notice, I booked the ticket. Unfortunately for me, issues arose I can no longer take this flight. I tried to cancel the flight online, which I did, trying to get my refund, which I didn't. I then tried to call and get my refund, only to be informed that there is a $200 fee for canceling my flight, and I would only get back what the ticket was worth minus that, a whopping $18 (which can only be used towards another flight). This is at two-plus months away from the flight, there is plenty of time for them to find a replacement for my seat. After sitting on hold for thirty minutes waiting for a representative, I was once again told there would be no refund, so I asked them to reinstate my ticket. There was no way I was going to allow this company to get double the profit off of my seat, I'd rather it stay empty. I then asked them if the ticket could be transferred to another person, so I could get someone to purchase the ticket from me. The answer is no. Not only that, but the representative on the phone sounded just as frustrated as I was. Lesson learned: I have to click two or three different links to learn what exactly what a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee"" is.

When I asked if my husband’s seat was also changed I was told it was not. When I said that was not acceptable (which I thought was obvious) I was told we could sit together in 7A and 7B. The problem was they failed to tell that to the person in 7B who was already on the plane. After attempting to get into 7A (a window seat) with minimal success, I sat in my original seat. At that point I was told I was in the wrong seat. When I explained the situation I was told I had been moved to accommodate other passengers who wished to sit together. Not OK.

"""unable to make our departure flight""",2019-08-26,2,Bonnie Peters,"✅ Trip Verified |  Denver to Detroit. Our friends always told us we needed to try the nicer airlines out, but we generally couldn’t afford it so we were excited when we found that Delta had a basic economy flight available for a trip home to visit my family. We though “Finally! We get to fly with an airline that treats their customers well!” Boy were we in for a surprise. I guess you only qualify for Deltas better treatment if you have the money to fly in one of their other classes. Just like everything else in this world, it seems Delta has subscribed to the idea that if you don’t have money, you are worthless and don’t deserve to be treated well. Through a course of events, my husband and I were unable to make our departure flight. When we realized we would not make our flight, I called to discuss what could be done. A Delta representative informed me that because I was a basic economy customer, they could not assist me over the phone, so when we arrived at the airport, we spoke with someone at the counter. The representative we spoke with was very condescending and entirely unhelpful. After scolding us for missing our original flight, they informed us that we would need to rebook and that the cost would be over $300 per passenger. Nowhere in that conversation did they indicate that we would need to rebook our entire trip. Not wanting to spend $600+ on top of what we had already spent, we booked a one-way trip with our usual economy airline. We thought our troubles were over. Sure, we were out a couple hundred dollars, but we made it to family vacation and we had a flight home .. or so we thought... We spent a great week with my family and returned to the airport for our flight back home only to find that our entire reservation had been canceled when we missed our first flight. The individual at the desk this time got on the phone to try to sort things out with us. They found that we would be expected to buy new tickets for a flight home. Again it was suggested that we pay over $300 per passenger to secure our flights home. The individual helping me at the desk held my hand and assured me they understood how I was feeling, but they couldn’t convince the person on the other side of the phone to help us. Eventually, the person on the other end of the phone conceded to crediting is with the cost of our original flights home so that we would pay the difference instead of the full charge to rebook. As if this was some sort of favor... we eventually concede to pay out of desperation to get home for work the next day. All in all, we essentially paid for our entire trip twice. Though the hit to my bank account was painful, the biggest sting wasn’t ultimately the cost; it was the loud and proud message that I only mattered to Delta as a customer if I had been willing to pay more money to them on the front end. Well Delta, you win. You have my money, but certainly not my respect, and surely not my business.

I not only fly Delta, I pay for the sky club every year and I have a Delta American Express card.

Late nights, early mornings, delayed flights, 60+ overnight stays a year away from my family and more. It’s a lot of sacrifice to be able to take advantage of miles I’ve worked extremely hard for once or twice a year, only find out, Delta can manipulate markets and gauge customers like me and pull all those decades of earned miles right out of my pocket in an instance. And not a few thousand, 100s of thousands! Which brings me to my issue. My fiancé is from Brazil. She comes from a big family with great tradition of family events and putting family first. Her parents are celebrating 50 years of marriage. We can not miss that event. I’ve been working on a trip to take advantage of my rewards from decades of travel. It occurred to me, that if I am to leave my native city (Atlanta) to Sau Paulo. The cost for us to leave Atlanta is outrageous. The points cost us more than double compared to other airports in the vicinity. We’re trying to work through it and be creative but it is a huge waste of time and energy. Not only in trying to source the trip and solve the problem, but also in having to fly to another airport just to preserve my hard earned points. And this email is just another big waste of my time. To make matters worse you’re having us leave an airport (Miami) we don’t even want to depart from, only to come back to Atlanta and do a 10 hour layover. To make matters worse my fiancé can not afford to travel that day to Miami and back to Atlanta, because she only has a sitter for the Atlanta to Sau Paulo trip and we’re struggling to find a way to keep her in Atlanta, even if I have to go out of my way to Miami, just to protect some of my hard earned points. If I was to transition her ticket to the Atlanta portion only, the cost to my personal point status is crippling. I’m writing to you because I’ve been loyal for decades.

You tag line, printed on your napkin (see photo) states, 'the world is better without you in it'. What you’re doing to me, my fiancé, her daughter and our trip flies in the face of this tag line. You’re supposed to encourage us to venture out, travel, adventure, etc.. Not discourage us and penalize us. I’m not some one-timer. Look at my vast history.

But this is a serious customer service issue. Other airlines still allow you to fly standby on earlier flights for free. Delta decided to be greedy and monetize this. It takes them very little effort and probably makes them more money in the long run to allow standby passengers for free. It make sure the flights are full and provides the airline better flexibility in later flights to change and add passengers. But, Delta decided to go to the dark side on this one, forgo good will to their customers and make that extra $75. I personally will make sure to fly United or Southwest in the future if I have the reasonable option. I'm not swearing off Delta entirely as I care for convenience in my travel first and foremost, but I do guarantee I will purchase at least a couple fewer Delta tickets this year.

"""I will never fly Delta again""",2019-08-09,1,B Edgcombe,"Not Verified |  Portland to Washington. I hate that I’m wasting more energy on Delta, but people need to know how they treat people, their kids, and their belongings. My kids had an unaccompanied minor reservation. Anytime you make an unaccompanied minor’s reservation, you have to do it over the phone. So when I got to the airport an hour and a half before my kids flight, Delta proceeded to tell me that they could not go through TSA because they had to be two hours early. I begin to explain to them that no one informed me of this very strict rule, and that I had no way of knowing that. They were condescending towards me and said it wasn’t their job to tell me when to be at the airport, and I could read it in the “contract I signed”. I informed them that I clearly haven’t signed anything, because it’s an airline requirement that I book over the phone. I asked if they could get a flight for them that same day, but they could not due to flight times. So I then asked if they could compensate us in someway for the inconvenience because I had to work a double the next day and they said no and I got upset and began to panic because I didn’t know what to do (I have severe anxiety), and she immediately got fed up with me and told me that she would not help me and that she would just document that I got there late (which is a lie). She then told me that I needed to call the unaccompanied minors hotline to change my kids flight if I wanted any help at all. I then called the hotline, and that person helped, and was apologetic. So because of this, I had to wake up at 4:30 a.m to get them to the airport on time and then go straight to work to work a double. But when we got to the airport the next day, and we were checking my daughters suitcase at the desk, the delta employee put her bag on the belt without  tagging it first! I look at her like... is my kids bag going to get lost? She assured me it would arrive to their destination. I didn’t believe them but I wasn’t going to waste time asking for management after the way I’d been treated before. So we finally get to the gate, and when they go to board the delta employee snaps at the parents to say their goodbyes and was just very stern in general, and when I was hugging my kids goodbye she snapped at me and said “you need to stay back” I just looked at her like “I’m just trying to hug them goodbye” and even another mom came up to me and said “they have no sympathy for moms with anxiety, do they?” And if only she knew the half of it. You’d think this review stops here, but it doesn’t. Hours after I send my kids off with these unprofessional people, which I wish I hadn’t, I get a text from my son saying that there was a problem with the gate, and that they got there late and we’re at a completely different airport. Mind you, I am paying a couple hundred dollars for someone to escort them to their gate on time, And to make sure they get to the correct destination and airport.

"""luggage was missing from her flight""",2019-07-07,1,S Keale,"Not Verified |  New York to Paris. I purchased three tickets for my mother and my daughters to travel to Paris together for the month of July since I was already in the city for my Master's program. My children checked-in with my brother who was going to Paris for the week since they arrived at the same time. When my mother arrived at check-in, she wasn't able to because the Delta agents in New York had put her name on my brother's luggage. My brother and daughters checked in around 6:30 PM and my mother didn't get to the airport until almost 8:00 PM to check-in for the same flight. The only thing they have in common is the same last name. The solution proposed by Delta was that she pay $100 to check-in her 1 bag as a second piece of luggage or have my brother come back out from the terminal so they could ""try to fix it"". Once you go through security, you can't come back out to the check-in counter. How do you ask someone to pay extra for your own incompetence and negligence? When you issue a baggage label you are looking at the passport, the boarding pass and the person in front of you. That's an extra level of incompetence on the part of Delta which makes me question their level of security. After their mistake, they gave my mother the run-around for over 30-minutes, then they told her that she wasn't able to check-in anymore because check-in stops one hour before boarding. There were a ton of agents just hanging around at the counters and no other customers. While they are saying this, my children and brother are texting me that the flight has been delayed and they are waiting at the terminal for an update. Then, Delta proposed that the only thing she could do was either re-book with them for a different flight on a different day and she would have to pay for the re-booking. Then they stated that they couldn't do anything because the ticket was purchased with a travel agency. After speaking to different Delta representatives and supervisors, through some ""miracle"", one of them rebooked her for a direct flight with Air France. She arrived in Paris 8 hours before my children and brother which was a major inconvenience. When all was done, my mother's luggage was missing from her flight with Air France as well as my brothers' from his flight. My children' pieces of luggage arrived one after the other on the conveyer belt. It's suspect that the two pieces of luggage missing happen to be the ones with my mother's name on them. So far, my brother's luggage was delivered the day after they arrived, but my mothers' has not yet been delivered. As of today July 6th (4 days after arrival), we were informed by Air France that they never received a marked bag for her from Delta and that her luggage is likely still in New York. They think that the baggage tag was ""probably removed"" from the suitcase which is why it never made it on the next direct flight. She's suffering from severe chronic asthma and diabetes because her extra medication was in her luggage. Now we're in Paris, she struggled to get around the past few days and had to be taken to the emergency room by ambulance today.

It used to be that they would announce close connections, allow those people to get off first. Not here. We were at the back of the plane and didn't de-board until 10:44. We had twenty-four min to make our connection in another part of airport. I asked gate attendant to call ahead and let them know we were coming. He shook his head no and we started at a dead run. Me and family (four of us) We made it there at 10:58. The gate was closed. They closed a full 15 min early, knowing they had a close-connecting flight. A couple there who were in the front of our plane arrived two min earlier than we did. The gate was not closed because it's ""regulation"" to close 15 min prior to take off. It closed 15 mins prior to take-off to board their standby employees. That's what I was later told. I would like proof of this but don't have it. Delta has it. The next morning June 13 we took a flight (DL3467) to Tulsa departing at 8:25. It closed its gate at 8:21. Four minutes prior to take-off. So it is not a regulation.

"""was absolutely horrific""",2019-06-26,1,Anna Grady,"✅ Trip Verified |  My experience with Delta Airlines was absolutely horrific and will be something I remember from my most recent trip for the rest of my life. My flight schedule was as follows, DFW->DTW->ORD (with Delta) -> BCN (Norwegian) My flight out of DFW was scheduled to depart to DTW at 7:15 AM. Due to ""technical difficulties,"" we sat boarded for two hours in the terminal. Finally, the airline crew then decided to restart the plane -literally turned it off, and turned it back on- and the issue resolved itself. This was not reassuring, as the pilot seemed to have a legitimate safety concern with the plane. It was also frustrating that it took them two hours to come to this solution. It goes without saying, I missed my connection from DTW to ORD due to this delay. The next flight out of DTW to ORD was at 3:55 which made it extremely close to missing the check-in deadline for my international flight with Norwegian at 6:30. Nevertheless, I was determined to make it work, so I got in the Delta Customer Service queue to make the arrangements. To preface this, the woman behind me in line had the exact same flight itinerary as me, so we were in the same dispositions. When I reached the counter they told me that there were no available seats at this time and that I would have to fly standby for the 3:55 flight and gave me a ticket for the 5:07 flight out of DTW - which would most definitely make me miss my international flight. I pleaded, nearly in tears, for her to do anything to help me as my flight with Norwegian was non-refundable. Unempathetically, she explained there was nothing she could do. After the line, I went to the restroom to catch my breath and met back up with the lady behind me to see what she was going to do. To my disgust and surprise, the same staff gave her a flight on the 3:55 PM seconds after she told me there was nothing she could do.  After I heard this, I got back in line and she conveniently found me a spot on the 3:55 PM flight. Once again, the flight was delayed for various reasons- one time they said technical and the other was the weather. I approached a different help desk, as now I 100% was going to miss my flight, and I was serviced by a different Delta employee (I did not catch her name but I wish I did). She proceeded to yell at me to the point I had to ask her to, ""Please, stop yelling at me."" She responded in a yelling voice, ""I am not yelling at you, just give me your ticket!"" This reduced me to tears of frustration and humiliation. When I boarded the plane, which was a full flight, I was looking for a space to put my carry-on in an overhead bin. The flight attendant, quite rudely said, ""Can you not see that these are closed? It means they are full."" Rather than offering help to a visibly upset individual she made me feel stupid and unwelcome.

Although we should not forget that they are on the flight for safety reasons and not only as waitresses and waiters. But I have my doubts that the age group of flight attendants during my flight is still able to do that. One flight attendant stumbled twice over a slight step on the floor. After so many years that should not happen any more. To make sure, it is not about youth and beauty, this is about safety. The service was excellent the food was fine and nothing to complain. The WiFi during the flight just for messages was amazing. I spend a lot of time by sending messages around the world. The seat was really old and not very comfortable. The length is okay but the width did not work at all. I was sorry that the new seats were not available. A big plus for me was the matter that my luggage could get through to Mexico.

"""a horrible experience""",2019-05-11,1,Ed Hirsch,"✅ Trip Verified |  
I booked a trip on Delta traveling from Atlanta to Milan via New York for a 9 day back country ski trip in the alps. The flight from ATL to NY was delayed over 2 hours leaving only 1 hour after landing in NY until the flight to Milan was taking off. I had 2 bags; one for skis and one for clothes and equipment. The skis made it onto the flight to Milan. The other bag did not. After arriving in Milan I was assured that the bag would arrive the next day and would be delivered to my hotel that was several hours away in the alps. The bag did arrive the next day to Milan, but it ended up held up in the airport for 3 days because the baggage company only delivers on Wednesday. By Wed, our group had moved to another country and needed the bag delivered to the new country. Trying to arrange for that with Delta was a complete waste of time after spending numerous hours on the phone with them. They never connected my bag to me for the entire 9 days that I was away. They ultimately delivered it to the wrong country. I had to track it down and pay someone to deliver it back to the airport at the end of the trip so that I would be reconnected with my clothes and equipment to go back home with me. I heard a lot of lip service from Delta about how much they valued my platinum medallion status , but it was all lip service and no action on their part. Delta was worthless in making any effort to connect me to my bag, and equipment that I needed for backcountry skiing. Additionally worthless was their compensation, or lack thereof, for making me go 9 days without the clothes and equipment that I needed. If you really need something for your trip I recommend contracting with a 3rd party delivery service company to get your stuff overseas, because you can't count on Delta at all.

Typical I hear for Florida which is out of the airlines control I understand. That's where the understanding ends. Our 1 hour layover got cut to 10 minutes to catch a connecting flight at a gate very far from our own. Upon finding out this information we spoke to the flight attendant and asked if they could give notification to the gate that we were still on our way and to inform them about the delay. The response was, hey don't worry about it, you can make it, no need for the call. So my pregnant wife and I were left running to our gate, making it 3 min past the departure time to watch our flight leaving the gate, and no attendant at the counter. At that point we just felt lost, and guess what, had to continue to wait till the attendant returned to the counter only to reply, ""Why didn't they just call? This could have been avoided?"" So at this point I am trying to keep my cool and am directed to the customer service counter. As I arrived at the Delta Customer service counter I am informed that there are no flights left for the night and no connecting flights. She gets us set up for the following day and a hotel accommodation. The customer service agent then gives us the packet and closes up for the night. We then wait for our tram, make it to the hotel just to find out that The reservations were reserved on a different name. And could not be checked in. We were informed by concierge that Delta would not accept the concierge changing the name and I would have to have customer service fax over the changes. I contact customer service who gave me a 40 min wait time before I could speak to a customer service rep, so not only has my pregnant wife had to run through an airport, call in sick for the following day and now have an at least 40 min wait till we can even check in for a flight 5 hours later. I request a call back and am returned a call an hour later just to get the response ""oh that Delta is different than this Delta, and you have to go back to the airport to get this changed. Ok, I figured maybe the rep just doesn't have the knowledge to fix the mistake, but no, after going through management I receive the same excuse even though they were able to pull up my flight information and transaction history. Oh I failed to mention during that 40 min wait time the concierge services were trying to contact Delta services via their vendor line and were getting continually hung up on by their rep line. So now I had to get a shuttle back, for the rep at the airline just for the rep to inform me that the place where my pregnant wife was staying at the moment wasn't even the hotel that my name had been reserved at. After going through the chain of events I had very little sympathy for any excuse that the airline had for trying to change us to a different hotel and was able to get the customer service rep to re-reserve the room in my name. I am writing this currently at the gate to my flight home so this travesty might continue, I figured that this would be enough to portray how much of a terrible experience this is.

Even though there were many seats available, because I had booked a basic economy ticket the agent did not allow me to get on the earlier flight. So I have to stay in ORF airport for a lot of hours and Delta gets to give up the possibility of selling my seat on the later flight because they are unwilling to let a ticketed passenger on an earlier flight that had 20 ish seats empty.

"""exhausting difficult flight experience""",2019-04-28,2,Jeri Carter,"Not Verified |  What a nightmare! Wish I would have read the reviews prior to my flight because from what I've read my experience appears to be the norm. I would have saved myself from an exhausting and difficult flight experience. This was the worst flight experience by far and I've come to the conclusion from reading the other reviews and my personal experience that customer fairness and customer satisfaction just isn't a priority for Delta Airlines. Had a flight from Baltimore to Boston with a layover in New York. There was severe weather and understandably there were delays. First flight was delayed, 56 mins, 1.5 hours, 5 hours to being cancelled and then diverted to Atlanta instead of New York. I had booked a day in advance for possible problems because I had a special event that I needed to attend the following day, with that being said I was traveling with two other relatives and they split us up by putting me on a flight that departed the same day (late night) which ended up being delayed. The little light in this is the Boarding Agent, she was very helpful in getting my 2 family members on the same flight and had to work alone in resolving multiple ticket issues because Delta had changed peoples flights without their knowledge. Thought we were good, but it gets better, we get off this flight and make it to the gate of the connecting flight and the agent was nowhere to be found. We can see our connecting flight, the agent finally comes to the front and we watch the plane taxiing back and he says ""that plane was boarded 7 minutes ago the doors are closed. They knew you were coming."" So if they knew we were coming on a delayed flight by minutes why were they allowed to leave? He wasn't concerned about our dilemma in the least bit. At this point it was 10:49pm after starting this nightmare at 1:30pm. I asked him to direct us to front reservations. The only other glimmer of light was the Reservation Agent who could only give us a next morning flight, by giving us a hotel voucher because I wasn't trying to spend the night in the airport. Collateral damage seems to be a part of Delta's protocol. It is my intention to never fly this airline again.

So, I get I have to show my ID often. I highly suggest, the company speaks with their flight attendants about ID’ing a guest before blatantly lying about not serving a drink that’s on the menu and also never coming back. I also asked for soft drinks or snacks and one of the flight attendants looked annoyed that I even asked her. It’s frustrating to get that type of service.

"""extremely unprofessional and rude""",2019-04-26,1,B Edwards,"✅ Trip Verified | I booked a flight with Delta to leave on 4/19/19 at 9 am, from Chicago to Phoenix. It was a connecting flight with a 30 minute layover in Detroit. Before getting on the plane, I informed the flight attendant of my short layover. I also found out 9 other passengers were going to Phoenix too. I asked politely if she could make an announcement at the end of the flight, so all 10 of us can get up before everyone else stands up.Her response “You better run”! During the duration of the flight, I asked multiple times if they can make the announcement, which they didn’t! Once we landed, we were waiting for about 10 minutes until we got off the plane because of Deltas incompetent flight attendants! Our flight arrived at gate 22 and our flight to Phoenix was departing from gate 74! I and 9 other passengers ran 50 gates down. Once we got to the gate, our plane was still there. I might mention they were still finishing up putting the luggage in. Flight attendant at the desk was there to inform us that they won’t open the door for us, even though they knew we were coming. All of us just stood there out of breath and watched our plane leave. Without being apologetic, she told us the next flight departs at 4:20pm. She was very informed though and mentioned to us that they were having problems due to weather conditions in the east coast. And Delta I must applaud you for how accurate your flight attendants are! Just like she warned us, our flight got delayed to 5:30, 6:30, 7:30 and then 8:30! All 10 of us ended up leaving Detroit at 8:50 and getting to Phoenix at 10:30! If it wasn’t for the flight attendants on the plane, all 10 of us would make it on time and be in Phoenix at 1pm! That 10 minutes (if the flight attendant would just make an announcement) when we were waiting for everyone to get off the plane, would’ve saved us from being stranded at the airport for 8 hours! I guess an announcement is way too much to ask Delta! Our plane left with 10 seats empty when they knew all other flights were getting cancelled. Some passengers from our flight got vouchers and some didn’t! I went to talk to someone at the Deltas help desk and got a privilege of once again speaking to another Deltas courteous flight attendant. She informed me and I’m quoting “you don’t deserve a voucher because it was your fault you didn’t make the flight,” You should’ve ran faster”. Ive asked to speak to the manager and she replied “good luck”. She also refused to give me any badge number, last name and refused to call the manager! After asking random flight attendants at the airport, I finally spoke to a supervisor and someone else that was above him. Both of them told me that I should call Delta. The only problem is that days after I still never got a call back! Delta, how are you allowed to sell connecting flights with 30 min layover when they’re 50 gates apart! Yes, I’ve heard from again very professional Delta flight attendants that I was the one who booked the flight. The problem is, you don’t inform anyone that you have to run 50 gates down while we re booking it. And you definitely don’t inform your costumers of flight attendants that instead of helping passengers, they’re extremely unprofessional and rude! To sum up this trip, Delta thank you for ruining my Easter!

We landed from Baltimore after a delay due to “severe weather” but for some reason that “severe weather” didn’t keep my flight to Cancun from leaving Atlanta without approximately 30 passengers that were coming from Baltimore.

She also provided the worst flights for us to choose from to make it an even horrible experience. But yet other customers had better flight options. I have never had this experience when flying. The worst customer service! It’s absolutely disappointing and at the same time surprising that I’ve had better contacts with Spirit. Southwest waits for its customers. And no discrimination between first class and those who can’t afford it. Oh and the reps who refused to provide exceptional customer service at the Delta counter in Atlanta and made the experience even worse. So for those who choose to fly using Delta, that’s what you expect to deal with. If you have a layover, not even because of the weather, will they wait for you. They will put you on the worst available flight even though there are better flights with only first class seats available.

After time spent on hold, Expedia told us we had to call Aeromexico, which we did but were told that their computers were down and so they would have to call us back. We were continuing to make calls to see if anyone at Delta, Expedia or Aeromexico could help when someone I knew entered the airport thru the entrance we were seated at. We came up with a ‘Hail Mary’ idea of consolidating our luggage into our carry-ons and sent our one big (now empty) suitcase home with her husband, who had just dropped her off at the airport. This allowed us to race thru security (having to dump a couple items we had neglected to remove in the haste of re-packing) and ran thru the airport to our gate, only to have missed the boarding cut-off by 10 minutes. We were sent to the Delta customer service desk and she too said she couldn’t help us because we had booked thru Expedia. So we spent the next three hours on the phone attempting to get on either the next flight out or the same flight the following day. Initially Aeromexico told us that they could rebook us and that we would have to pay an extra $215 per ticket, but no one at Aeromexico seemed capable of completing that task. While my husband was on the phone with them, I was on the phone with Expedia and eventually was connected with a manager who tried to help by speaking with Aeromexico. In the two hours we were on the phone the news kept getting worse. In the end, Aeromexico refused to rebook our flights because even though we called them before we had officially missed the flight, they said that since we “no-showed” they had since forfeited our return flights (which were actually thru Delta) and now, hours later, if they rebooked our flight to Mexico, there weren’t any available flights to get us home. To add insult to injury, they refused to refund any of our $2900 for the flights that they had refused to re-book and wouldn’t give any vouchers or credit for future travel either. Since we were canceling so late, we also had to pay for two of the three hotel nights too. I would not recommend flying with Aeromexico but I’m also disappointed in the service (or lack there of) provided by Delta.

The second segment from ATL to CUN was also okay and only a short 2hrs flight, same counts for the way back CUN to ATL. Then it all started...for the last segment we thought, lets go comfort and have better experience. We had seats in row 21 (E+F) next to emergency exit. It was horrible cold even with three blankets covering my legs, result of that was/is having a nice cold when arrived home. The blankets are joke btw. Also the ear plugs do not do what they should do. I have not tested the headphones as they have no ANC in economy so i used my own. The food on Comfort plus was exactly the same like standard economy so not worth spending additional money on Comfort.. I still give 5 out of 10 as the rest was okay.

Most disturbing, though, is the quality of the interior. It is very evident that costs were cut, as things are breaking down quickly.
