Customer service has been useless on how to handle the situation and no one calls back when they say they will. I’ve had to go to the airport every day for 2 weeks straight and also sent someone in JFK to go to Delta baggage services personally only for them not to be able to help. I ended up having to file a claim and Delta is asking for receipts of all my stuff in the bag-which is ridiculous because how do they expect me to have receipts for items purchased years ago? Did I ask for my bag to be lost? The claims manager never answers his phone or returns messages. This is so unacceptable and I’ve had enough of this nonsense. I paid so much for my ticket-not to mention all my valuables inside the suitcase which Delta compensate me for. I need my bag back and Delta at this point feels they can be careless and pay me off (which they cannot because they would give me way less than what everything costs) and get away with it.

"""bad ground and customer service""",2019-10-26,1,S Tan,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delta repeatedly has bad ground and customer service staff. The breaking point which compelled me to write a feedback on this airline after flying with them for so many years came when they did not handle my luggage professionally. When there was damages found on the bags, the ground agents denied liabilities and accuse the fault was on passengers. The same was true to other passengers who experienced the same problem on the same flight when in Singapore from the US via Tokyo. After filing complaint to the customer service, the customer service took more than 14 days to reply (when in their auto reply email stated they would reply within 14 days) and the customer service would defend their mistakes and continue laying blame on the passengers. I have been their top level frequent fliers but I never felt I was treated like one at all. They don't offer any preferential check in, retrieval of luggage bags above their usual sky priority which a simple comfort + would earn the similar treatment while being the top frequent fliers on other alliance group or airlines would have offered 1st class service than Delta offering merely the same like comfort +. Service recovery is bad. The staff are not trained or geared towards high value customers at all. Having a Porsche for tight connection is nothing premium when other airlines offer direct boarding from lounge like Emirates or complimentary limousine airport transfers such as from JL, MH and so on. They appear to prefer paid business class passengers but their products and services completely do NOT match up to any full service airlines that have business class product. Their lounge is always filled with so many people and refreshment are really just plain refreshment (basic snacks NOT food) and very often, their lounges do NOT even have shower facilities. So don't even count on having complimentary spa/massage/sleeping area etc. Their planes are dirty and old yet the ticket fares are expensive. Amenities frequently not working for example IFE doesn't work, USB not charging, food stuck in between seats, chewing gums found in aircraft safety menu, dirty toilets, broken window shades and Delta has a policy where instead of bumping revenue passengers to higher classes when seats are needed, they would instead bump their non revenue employees or families/kins onto business class seats especially on international route. Their complimentary first class upgrade almost hardly happen to any members as it will always be full. Delta will always try not to offer the upgrade until at boarding and by which time, all the first class seats would be taken up already. So don't be fooled by the benefits stated on their website for their frequent fliers programme. Their hidden clause to defend their misrepresentation would be ""whenever available"". To Delta, available for revenue tickets doesn't mean available for upgrade. There is absolutely no incentives being their frequent fliers especially for international travellers. They are just a commuter airline within US or regional at best. So Delta best if ever rated best is best within the US only. In one word to describe Delta and by International Standard, avoid  it.

Explanation: Delta had flown in with a different aircraft. But we were assured that we would nonetheless have Comfort Plus seats being ‘the equivalent of Premium Select’.

Checking the safety instructions in the seat pocket, it turned out that the plane in question was a Boeing 777-200 in a configuration not available on Delta’s web site. Probably an older version, because my table was hanging toward me, making my food tray almost landing on my lap. What I reproach Delta most of all is that they were not straightforward.

The flight left on time and as it departed late afternoon, I got to eat a meal on Delta and it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. It was average quality airline food. The IFE was reasonable for a domestic route. The typical reviews I read of US-based airlines mention how terrible the flight attendants are. However, the flight crew on this flight was professional and courteous. So, I thought I was fortunate to get a good crew. Upon reading little more on the US based airlines, it seems Delta has a better operation and more motivated workforce than American or United. Well, I hope they keep improving as all of them have a long way to go to compete effectively with many of the Middle Eastern and Asian airlines. If it wasn't for the US government protecting the domestic market for these carriers from their overseas competitors, they would have stopped operating long time before they went through their multi-year bankruptcy.

I have tried calling the corporate line 3 times and no answer. I sent them a complaint requesting a call back, nothing. So now I’ll share my experience with everyone I can. Our flight returning home from Hawaii was delayed 5 hours by the time we took off. It didn’t leave until after 2am when all was said and done. We had no where to go as everything closes early in Kauai, extra expenses related to rental car late return, had more expenses due to staying longer (food), had to try to make arrangements for kids that were supposed to be dropped off at our house by a certain time, and most importantly wasted my time and caused a lot of unneeded stress. I think of experiences I have had with companies in the past and this one far surpasses any negative experience I have had in the past. I called when we realized it was delayed, which was further delayed once more. I got a CS person that really was not helpful at all. They offered $100 for my troubles. I asked for a manager and he told me that is all they could do. Got the manager and she mentioned they might be able to do a bit more and never recorded the call or offer. I was so frustrated that my friends I was traveling with decided to call as I was getting really frustrated. My screen did not work on the way to Hawaii. My wife’s screen did not work on the way back. I cannot believe the lack of customer support. Any business I can think of that I have had a negative experience with has tried to rectify the negative experience. I feel you have to beg for help with Delta. I personally feel Delta does not care about its customers. A follow up call or apology coming from Delta would have been highly appropriate. Frankly if I had this type of experience at my business we’d bend over backwards to make it right. Delta has not done squat! I think they figure they’re big enough it really doesn’t matter.

We came 3 hours early and was forced to check in our carry on bags as some other passengers used our storage.

They were boarding groups 1 and 2 but a bunch of people who were from group 3 cut in and nobody checked. Our group followed the rules by waiting for the group we were assigned and it was a big mistake! All the storage was taken so we were forced to check our carry on bags. Staff were also very unorganized, unprofessional and never apologized. One of them at the front desk told me ""you can wait for another later flight but it was already 11pm"" when I had commented about our situation which was rude and made the situation worse. Then when we sat my seat belt was broken and no one checked. Then the flight attendant completely skipped our row for drinks and ignored us. After an hour of waiting and being patient for the hope that one flight attendant would notice my husband hit the button to calmly explain that we were skipped for drinks. We never received any apology for anyone and were treated as second class passengers.

"""told there would be no refund""",2019-09-13,1,M Dehmer,"Not Verified |  About a week ago I decided to book a one-way flight with Delta out of Bismark to Minneapolis. Unfortunately, they were one of two airlines flying from there. Everything was going well and I purchased my ticket with a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee."" What is very misleading about this is that the airline does not specify which 24 hours these are. You can only get a refund within 24 hours of purchasing the ticket, not before the flight takes place. So with this assumption that the flight could be canceled and refunded as long as there was a 24 hour in advance notice, I booked the ticket. Unfortunately for me, issues arose I can no longer take this flight. I tried to cancel the flight online, which I did, trying to get my refund, which I didn't. I then tried to call and get my refund, only to be informed that there is a $200 fee for canceling my flight, and I would only get back what the ticket was worth minus that, a whopping $18 (which can only be used towards another flight). This is at two-plus months away from the flight, there is plenty of time for them to find a replacement for my seat. After sitting on hold for thirty minutes waiting for a representative, I was once again told there would be no refund, so I asked them to reinstate my ticket. There was no way I was going to allow this company to get double the profit off of my seat, I'd rather it stay empty. I then asked them if the ticket could be transferred to another person, so I could get someone to purchase the ticket from me. The answer is no. Not only that, but the representative on the phone sounded just as frustrated as I was. Lesson learned: I have to click two or three different links to learn what exactly what a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee"" is. On top of that, I should know not to trust what a big company shows at face value. Even if for some odd reason I would get the chance to take this flight, I wouldn't.

When I asked if my husband’s seat was also changed I was told it was not. When I said that was not acceptable (which I thought was obvious) I was told we could sit together in 7A and 7B. The problem was they failed to tell that to the person in 7B who was already on the plane. After attempting to get into 7A (a window seat) with minimal success, I sat in my original seat. At that point I was told I was in the wrong seat. When I explained the situation I was told I had been moved to accommodate other passengers who wished to sit together. Not OK.

"""unable to make our departure flight""",2019-08-26,2,Bonnie Peters,"✅ Trip Verified |  Denver to Detroit. Our friends always told us we needed to try the nicer airlines out, but we generally couldn’t afford it so we were excited when we found that Delta had a basic economy flight available for a trip home to visit my family. We though “Finally! We get to fly with an airline that treats their customers well!” Boy were we in for a surprise. I guess you only qualify for Deltas better treatment if you have the money to fly in one of their other classes. Just like everything else in this world, it seems Delta has subscribed to the idea that if you don’t have money, you are worthless and don’t deserve to be treated well. Through a course of events, my husband and I were unable to make our departure flight. When we realized we would not make our flight, I called to discuss what could be done. A Delta representative informed me that because I was a basic economy customer, they could not assist me over the phone, so when we arrived at the airport, we spoke with someone at the counter. The representative we spoke with was very condescending and entirely unhelpful. After scolding us for missing our original flight, they informed us that we would need to rebook and that the cost would be over $300 per passenger. Nowhere in that conversation did they indicate that we would need to rebook our entire trip. Not wanting to spend $600+ on top of what we had already spent, we booked a one-way trip with our usual economy airline. We thought our troubles were over. Sure, we were out a couple hundred dollars, but we made it to family vacation and we had a flight home .. or so we thought... We spent a great week with my family and returned to the airport for our flight back home only to find that our entire reservation had been canceled when we missed our first flight. The individual at the desk this time got on the phone to try to sort things out with us. They found that we would be expected to buy new tickets for a flight home. Again it was suggested that we pay over $300 per passenger to secure our flights home. The individual helping me at the desk held my hand and assured me they understood how I was feeling, but they couldn’t convince the person on the other side of the phone to help us. Eventually, the person on the other end of the phone conceded to crediting is with the cost of our original flights home so that we would pay the difference instead of the full charge to rebook. As if this was some sort of favor... we eventually concede to pay out of desperation to get home for work the next day. All in all, we essentially paid for our entire trip twice. Though the hit to my bank account was painful, the biggest sting wasn’t ultimately the cost; it was the loud and proud message that I only mattered to Delta as a customer if I had been willing to pay more money to them on the front end. Well Delta, you win. You have my money, but certainly not my respect, and surely not my business.

Late nights, early mornings, delayed flights, 60+ overnight stays a year away from my family and more. It’s a lot of sacrifice to be able to take advantage of miles I’ve worked extremely hard for once or twice a year, only find out, Delta can manipulate markets and gauge customers like me and pull all those decades of earned miles right out of my pocket in an instance. And not a few thousand, 100s of thousands! Which brings me to my issue. My fiancé is from Brazil. She comes from a big family with great tradition of family events and putting family first. Her parents are celebrating 50 years of marriage. We can not miss that event. I’ve been working on a trip to take advantage of my rewards from decades of travel. It occurred to me, that if I am to leave my native city (Atlanta) to Sau Paulo. The cost for us to leave Atlanta is outrageous. The points cost us more than double compared to other airports in the vicinity. We’re trying to work through it and be creative but it is a huge waste of time and energy. Not only in trying to source the trip and solve the problem, but also in having to fly to another airport just to preserve my hard earned points. And this email is just another big waste of my time. To make matters worse you’re having us leave an airport (Miami) we don’t even want to depart from, only to come back to Atlanta and do a 10 hour layover. To make matters worse my fiancé can not afford to travel that day to Miami and back to Atlanta, because she only has a sitter for the Atlanta to Sau Paulo trip and we’re struggling to find a way to keep her in Atlanta, even if I have to go out of my way to Miami, just to protect some of my hard earned points. If I was to transition her ticket to the Atlanta portion only, the cost to my personal point status is crippling. I’m writing to you because I’ve been loyal for decades.

But this is a serious customer service issue. Other airlines still allow you to fly standby on earlier flights for free. Delta decided to be greedy and monetize this. It takes them very little effort and probably makes them more money in the long run to allow standby passengers for free. It make sure the flights are full and provides the airline better flexibility in later flights to change and add passengers. But, Delta decided to go to the dark side on this one, forgo good will to their customers and make that extra $75. I personally will make sure to fly United or Southwest in the future if I have the reasonable option. I'm not swearing off Delta entirely as I care for convenience in my travel first and foremost, but I do guarantee I will purchase at least a couple fewer Delta tickets this year.

At the time of the boarding after standing in line we were told by the stewardess in a pretty rude tone that my brother will be boarding the last. We waited for an entire airplane to board and the stewardess finally nodded us that we can go ahead. She then printed additional slip and without showing it to me took my brother to board. When the plane took off, my brother texted me that he was seated to the seat #17 in between two other passengers and his requested and already assigned seat was given away to somebody else.

I hate that I’m wasting more energy on Delta, but people need to know how they treat people, their kids, and their belongings. My kids had an unaccompanied minor reservation. Anytime you make an unaccompanied minor’s reservation, you have to do it over the phone. So when I got to the airport an hour and a half before my kids flight, Delta proceeded to tell me that they could not go through TSA because they had to be two hours early. I begin to explain to them that no one informed me of this very strict rule, and that I had no way of knowing that. They were condescending towards me and said it wasn’t their job to tell me when to be at the airport, and I could read it in the “contract I signed”. I informed them that I clearly haven’t signed anything, because it’s an airline requirement that I book over the phone. I asked if they could get a flight for them that same day, but they could not due to flight times. So I then asked if they could compensate us in someway for the inconvenience because I had to work a double the next day and they said no and I got upset and began to panic because I didn’t know what to do (I have severe anxiety), and she immediately got fed up with me and told me that she would not help me and that she would just document that I got there late (which is a lie). She then told me that I needed to call the unaccompanied minors hotline to change my kids flight if I wanted any help at all. I then called the hotline, and that person helped, and was apologetic. So because of this, I had to wake up at 4:30 a.m to get them to the airport on time and then go straight to work to work a double. But when we got to the airport the next day, and we were checking my daughters suitcase at the desk, the delta employee put her bag on the belt without  tagging it first! I look at her like... is my kids bag going to get lost? She assured me it would arrive to their destination. I didn’t believe them but I wasn’t going to waste time asking for management after the way I’d been treated before. So we finally get to the gate, and when they go to board the delta employee snaps at the parents to say their goodbyes and was just very stern in general, and when I was hugging my kids goodbye she snapped at me and said “you need to stay back” I just looked at her like “I’m just trying to hug them goodbye” and even another mom came up to me and said “they have no sympathy for moms with anxiety, do they?” And if only she knew the half of it. You’d think this review stops here, but it doesn’t. Hours after I send my kids off with these unprofessional people, which I wish I hadn’t, I get a text from my son saying that there was a problem with the gate, and that they got there late and we’re at a completely different airport. Mind you, I am paying a couple hundred dollars for someone to escort them to their gate on time, And to make sure they get to the correct destination and airport. And THEN I find out that they in fact sent my kids suitcase to the wrong airport, and their dad had to drive to two different airports and pay $50 in parking.

"""luggage was missing from her flight""",2019-07-07,1,S Keale,"Not Verified |  New York to Paris. I purchased three tickets for my mother and my daughters to travel to Paris together for the month of July since I was already in the city for my Master's program. My children checked-in with my brother who was going to Paris for the week since they arrived at the same time. When my mother arrived at check-in, she wasn't able to because the Delta agents in New York had put her name on my brother's luggage. My brother and daughters checked in around 6:30 PM and my mother didn't get to the airport until almost 8:00 PM to check-in for the same flight. The only thing they have in common is the same last name. The solution proposed by Delta was that she pay $100 to check-in her 1 bag as a second piece of luggage or have my brother come back out from the terminal so they could ""try to fix it"". Once you go through security, you can't come back out to the check-in counter. How do you ask someone to pay extra for your own incompetence and negligence? When you issue a baggage label you are looking at the passport, the boarding pass and the person in front of you. That's an extra level of incompetence on the part of Delta which makes me question their level of security. After their mistake, they gave my mother the run-around for over 30-minutes, then they told her that she wasn't able to check-in anymore because check-in stops one hour before boarding. There were a ton of agents just hanging around at the counters and no other customers. While they are saying this, my children and brother are texting me that the flight has been delayed and they are waiting at the terminal for an update. Then, Delta proposed that the only thing she could do was either re-book with them for a different flight on a different day and she would have to pay for the re-booking. Then they stated that they couldn't do anything because the ticket was purchased with a travel agency. After speaking to different Delta representatives and supervisors, through some ""miracle"", one of them rebooked her for a direct flight with Air France. She arrived in Paris 8 hours before my children and brother which was a major inconvenience. When all was done, my mother's luggage was missing from her flight with Air France as well as my brothers' from his flight. My children' pieces of luggage arrived one after the other on the conveyer belt. It's suspect that the two pieces of luggage missing happen to be the ones with my mother's name on them. So far, my brother's luggage was delivered the day after they arrived, but my mothers' has not yet been delivered. As of today July 6th (4 days after arrival), we were informed by Air France that they never received a marked bag for her from Delta and that her luggage is likely still in New York. They think that the baggage tag was ""probably removed"" from the suitcase which is why it never made it on the next direct flight. She's suffering from severe chronic asthma and diabetes because her extra medication was in her luggage. Now we're in Paris, she struggled to get around the past few days and had to be taken to the emergency room by ambulance today.

It used to be that they would announce close connections, allow those people to get off first. Not here. We were at the back of the plane and didn't de-board until 10:44. We had twenty-four min to make our connection in another part of airport. I asked gate attendant to call ahead and let them know we were coming. He shook his head no and we started at a dead run. Me and family (four of us) We made it there at 10:58. The gate was closed. They closed a full 15 min early, knowing they had a close-connecting flight. A couple there who were in the front of our plane arrived two min earlier than we did. The gate was not closed because it's ""regulation"" to close 15 min prior to take off. It closed 15 mins prior to take-off to board their standby employees. That's what I was later told. I would like proof of this but don't have it. Delta has it. The next morning June 13 we took a flight (DL3467) to Tulsa departing at 8:25. It closed its gate at 8:21. Four minutes prior to take-off. So it is not a regulation.

"""was absolutely horrific""",2019-06-26,1,Anna Grady,"✅ Trip Verified |  My experience with Delta Airlines was absolutely horrific and will be something I remember from my most recent trip for the rest of my life. My flight schedule was as follows, DFW->DTW->ORD (with Delta) -> BCN (Norwegian) My flight out of DFW was scheduled to depart to DTW at 7:15 AM. Due to ""technical difficulties,"" we sat boarded for two hours in the terminal. Finally, the airline crew then decided to restart the plane -literally turned it off, and turned it back on- and the issue resolved itself. This was not reassuring, as the pilot seemed to have a legitimate safety concern with the plane. It was also frustrating that it took them two hours to come to this solution. It goes without saying, I missed my connection from DTW to ORD due to this delay. The next flight out of DTW to ORD was at 3:55 which made it extremely close to missing the check-in deadline for my international flight with Norwegian at 6:30. Nevertheless, I was determined to make it work, so I got in the Delta Customer Service queue to make the arrangements. To preface this, the woman behind me in line had the exact same flight itinerary as me, so we were in the same dispositions. When I reached the counter they told me that there were no available seats at this time and that I would have to fly standby for the 3:55 flight and gave me a ticket for the 5:07 flight out of DTW - which would most definitely make me miss my international flight. I pleaded, nearly in tears, for her to do anything to help me as my flight with Norwegian was non-refundable. Unempathetically, she explained there was nothing she could do. After the line, I went to the restroom to catch my breath and met back up with the lady behind me to see what she was going to do. To my disgust and surprise, the same staff gave her a flight on the 3:55 PM seconds after she told me there was nothing she could do.  After I heard this, I got back in line and she conveniently found me a spot on the 3:55 PM flight. Once again, the flight was delayed for various reasons- one time they said technical and the other was the weather. I approached a different help desk, as now I 100% was going to miss my flight, and I was serviced by a different Delta employee (I did not catch her name but I wish I did). She proceeded to yell at me to the point I had to ask her to, ""Please, stop yelling at me."" She responded in a yelling voice, ""I am not yelling at you, just give me your ticket!"" This reduced me to tears of frustration and humiliation. When I boarded the plane, which was a full flight, I was looking for a space to put my carry-on in an overhead bin. The flight attendant, quite rudely said, ""Can you not see that these are closed? It means they are full."" Rather than offering help to a visibly upset individual she made me feel stupid and unwelcome.

But I have my doubts that the age group of flight attendants during my flight is still able to do that. One flight attendant stumbled twice over a slight step on the floor. After so many years that should not happen any more. To make sure, it is not about youth and beauty, this is about safety. The service was excellent the food was fine and nothing to complain. The WiFi during the flight just for messages was amazing. I spend a lot of time by sending messages around the world. The seat was really old and not very comfortable. The length is okay but the width did not work at all. I was sorry that the new seats were not available. A big plus for me was the matter that my luggage could get through to Mexico.

"""a horrible experience""",2019-05-11,1,Ed Hirsch,"✅ Trip Verified |  
I booked a trip on Delta traveling from Atlanta to Milan via New York for a 9 day back country ski trip in the alps. The flight from ATL to NY was delayed over 2 hours leaving only 1 hour after landing in NY until the flight to Milan was taking off. I had 2 bags; one for skis and one for clothes and equipment. The skis made it onto the flight to Milan. The other bag did not. After arriving in Milan I was assured that the bag would arrive the next day and would be delivered to my hotel that was several hours away in the alps. The bag did arrive the next day to Milan, but it ended up held up in the airport for 3 days because the baggage company only delivers on Wednesday. By Wed, our group had moved to another country and needed the bag delivered to the new country. Trying to arrange for that with Delta was a complete waste of time after spending numerous hours on the phone with them. They never connected my bag to me for the entire 9 days that I was away. They ultimately delivered it to the wrong country. I had to track it down and pay someone to deliver it back to the airport at the end of the trip so that I would be reconnected with my clothes and equipment to go back home with me. I heard a lot of lip service from Delta about how much they valued my platinum medallion status , but it was all lip service and no action on their part. Delta was worthless in making any effort to connect me to my bag, and equipment that I needed for backcountry skiing. Additionally worthless was their compensation, or lack thereof, for making me go 9 days without the clothes and equipment that I needed. If you really need something for your trip I recommend contracting with a 3rd party delivery service company to get your stuff overseas, because you can't count on Delta at all.

"""a terrible experience""",2019-05-09,1,Doug Davis,"✅ Trip Verified | Where do I start? We started our journey from Florida and had a delay due to a storm warning. Typical I hear for Florida which is out of the airlines control I understand. That's where the understanding ends. Our 1 hour layover got cut to 10 minutes to catch a connecting flight at a gate very far from our own. Upon finding out this information we spoke to the flight attendant and asked if they could give notification to the gate that we were still on our way and to inform them about the delay. The response was, hey don't worry about it, you can make it, no need for the call. So my pregnant wife and I were left running to our gate, making it 3 min past the departure time to watch our flight leaving the gate, and no attendant at the counter. At that point we just felt lost, and guess what, had to continue to wait till the attendant returned to the counter only to reply, ""Why didn't they just call? This could have been avoided?"" So at this point I am trying to keep my cool and am directed to the customer service counter. As I arrived at the Delta Customer service counter I am informed that there are no flights left for the night and no connecting flights. She gets us set up for the following day and a hotel accommodation. The customer service agent then gives us the packet and closes up for the night. We then wait for our tram, make it to the hotel just to find out that The reservations were reserved on a different name. And could not be checked in. We were informed by concierge that Delta would not accept the concierge changing the name and I would have to have customer service fax over the changes. I contact customer service who gave me a 40 min wait time before I could speak to a customer service rep, so not only has my pregnant wife had to run through an airport, call in sick for the following day and now have an at least 40 min wait till we can even check in for a flight 5 hours later. I request a call back and am returned a call an hour later just to get the response ""oh that Delta is different than this Delta, and you have to go back to the airport to get this changed. Ok, I figured maybe the rep just doesn't have the knowledge to fix the mistake, but no, after going through management I receive the same excuse even though they were able to pull up my flight information and transaction history. Oh I failed to mention during that 40 min wait time the concierge services were trying to contact Delta services via their vendor line and were getting continually hung up on by their rep line. So now I had to get a shuttle back, for the rep at the airline just for the rep to inform me that the place where my pregnant wife was staying at the moment wasn't even the hotel that my name had been reserved at. After going through the chain of events I had very little sympathy for any excuse that the airline had for trying to change us to a different hotel and was able to get the customer service rep to re-reserve the room in my name. I am writing this currently at the gate to my flight home so this travesty might continue, I figured that this would be enough to portray how much of a terrible experience this is.

"""exhausting difficult flight experience""",2019-04-28,2,Jeri Carter,"Not Verified |  What a nightmare! Wish I would have read the reviews prior to my flight because from what I've read my experience appears to be the norm. I would have saved myself from an exhausting and difficult flight experience. This was the worst flight experience by far and I've come to the conclusion from reading the other reviews and my personal experience that customer fairness and customer satisfaction just isn't a priority for Delta Airlines. Had a flight from Baltimore to Boston with a layover in New York. There was severe weather and understandably there were delays. First flight was delayed, 56 mins, 1.5 hours, 5 hours to being cancelled and then diverted to Atlanta instead of New York. I had booked a day in advance for possible problems because I had a special event that I needed to attend the following day, with that being said I was traveling with two other relatives and they split us up by putting me on a flight that departed the same day (late night) which ended up being delayed. The little light in this is the Boarding Agent, she was very helpful in getting my 2 family members on the same flight and had to work alone in resolving multiple ticket issues because Delta had changed peoples flights without their knowledge. Thought we were good, but it gets better, we get off this flight and make it to the gate of the connecting flight and the agent was nowhere to be found. We can see our connecting flight, the agent finally comes to the front and we watch the plane taxiing back and he says ""that plane was boarded 7 minutes ago the doors are closed. They knew you were coming."" So if they knew we were coming on a delayed flight by minutes why were they allowed to leave? He wasn't concerned about our dilemma in the least bit. At this point it was 10:49pm after starting this nightmare at 1:30pm. I asked him to direct us to front reservations. The only other glimmer of light was the Reservation Agent who could only give us a next morning flight, by giving us a hotel voucher because I wasn't trying to spend the night in the airport. Collateral damage seems to be a part of Delta's protocol. It is my intention to never fly this airline again.

So, I get I have to show my ID often. I highly suggest, the company speaks with their flight attendants about ID’ing a guest before blatantly lying about not serving a drink that’s on the menu and also never coming back. I also asked for soft drinks or snacks and one of the flight attendants looked annoyed that I even asked her. It’s frustrating to get that type of service.

"""extremely unprofessional and rude""",2019-04-26,1,B Edwards,"✅ Trip Verified | I booked a flight with Delta to leave on 4/19/19 at 9 am, from Chicago to Phoenix. It was a connecting flight with a 30 minute layover in Detroit. Before getting on the plane, I informed the flight attendant of my short layover. I also found out 9 other passengers were going to Phoenix too. I asked politely if she could make an announcement at the end of the flight, so all 10 of us can get up before everyone else stands up.Her response “You better run”! During the duration of the flight, I asked multiple times if they can make the announcement, which they didn’t! Once we landed, we were waiting for about 10 minutes until we got off the plane because of Deltas incompetent flight attendants! Our flight arrived at gate 22 and our flight to Phoenix was departing from gate 74! I and 9 other passengers ran 50 gates down. Once we got to the gate, our plane was still there. I might mention they were still finishing up putting the luggage in. Flight attendant at the desk was there to inform us that they won’t open the door for us, even though they knew we were coming. All of us just stood there out of breath and watched our plane leave. Without being apologetic, she told us the next flight departs at 4:20pm. She was very informed though and mentioned to us that they were having problems due to weather conditions in the east coast. And Delta I must applaud you for how accurate your flight attendants are! Just like she warned us, our flight got delayed to 5:30, 6:30, 7:30 and then 8:30! All 10 of us ended up leaving Detroit at 8:50 and getting to Phoenix at 10:30! If it wasn’t for the flight attendants on the plane, all 10 of us would make it on time and be in Phoenix at 1pm! That 10 minutes (if the flight attendant would just make an announcement) when we were waiting for everyone to get off the plane, would’ve saved us from being stranded at the airport for 8 hours! I guess an announcement is way too much to ask Delta! Our plane left with 10 seats empty when they knew all other flights were getting cancelled. Some passengers from our flight got vouchers and some didn’t! I went to talk to someone at the Deltas help desk and got a privilege of once again speaking to another Deltas courteous flight attendant. She informed me and I’m quoting “you don’t deserve a voucher because it was your fault you didn’t make the flight,” You should’ve ran faster”. Ive asked to speak to the manager and she replied “good luck”. She also refused to give me any badge number, last name and refused to call the manager! After asking random flight attendants at the airport, I finally spoke to a supervisor and someone else that was above him. Both of them told me that I should call Delta. The only problem is that days after I still never got a call back! Delta, how are you allowed to sell connecting flights with 30 min layover when they’re 50 gates apart! Yes, I’ve heard from again very professional Delta flight attendants that I was the one who booked the flight. The problem is, you don’t inform anyone that you have to run 50 gates down while we re booking it. And you definitely don’t inform your costumers of flight attendants that instead of helping passengers, they’re extremely unprofessional and rude! To sum up this trip, Delta thank you for ruining my Easter!

We landed from Baltimore after a delay due to “severe weather” but for some reason that “severe weather” didn’t keep my flight to Cancun from leaving Atlanta without approximately 30 passengers that were coming from Baltimore.

She also provided the worst flights for us to choose from to make it an even horrible experience. But yet other customers had better flight options. I have never had this experience when flying. The worst customer service! It’s absolutely disappointing and at the same time surprising that I’ve had better contacts with Spirit. Southwest waits for its customers. And no discrimination between first class and those who can’t afford it. Oh and the reps who refused to provide exceptional customer service at the Delta counter in Atlanta and made the experience even worse. So for those who choose to fly using Delta, that’s what you expect to deal with. If you have a layover, not even because of the weather, will they wait for you. They will put you on the worst available flight even though there are better flights with only first class seats available. Delta will not give up their first class seats to you because you paid for economy though “weather” screwed up your layover.

This allowed us to race thru security (having to dump a couple items we had neglected to remove in the haste of re-packing) and ran thru the airport to our gate, only to have missed the boarding cut-off by 10 minutes. We were sent to the Delta customer service desk and she too said she couldn’t help us because we had booked thru Expedia. So we spent the next three hours on the phone attempting to get on either the next flight out or the same flight the following day. Initially Aeromexico told us that they could rebook us and that we would have to pay an extra $215 per ticket, but no one at Aeromexico seemed capable of completing that task. While my husband was on the phone with them, I was on the phone with Expedia and eventually was connected with a manager who tried to help by speaking with Aeromexico. In the two hours we were on the phone the news kept getting worse. In the end, Aeromexico refused to rebook our flights because even though we called them before we had officially missed the flight, they said that since we “no-showed” they had since forfeited our return flights (which were actually thru Delta) and now, hours later, if they rebooked our flight to Mexico, there weren’t any available flights to get us home. To add insult to injury, they refused to refund any of our $2900 for the flights that they had refused to re-book and wouldn’t give any vouchers or credit for future travel either. Since we were canceling so late, we also had to pay for two of the three hotel nights too. I would not recommend flying with Aeromexico but I’m also disappointed in the service (or lack there of) provided by Delta.

The IFE system has lots of films series and what not, Sadly you cannot adjust the angle of the screen which is not good as it is hard to see anything when the person in front of you pushs the seat back. The second segment from ATL to CUN was also okay and only a short 2hrs flight, same counts for the way back CUN to ATL. Then it all started...for the last segment we thought, lets go comfort and have better experience. We had seats in row 21 (E+F) next to emergency exit. It was horrible cold even with three blankets covering my legs, result of that was/is having a nice cold when arrived home. The blankets are joke btw. Also the ear plugs do not do what they should do. I have not tested the headphones as they have no ANC in economy so i used my own. The food on Comfort plus was exactly the same like standard economy so not worth spending additional money on Comfort.. I still give 5 out of 10 as the rest was okay.

Additionally, we opted to go Business class with 1st class flights with the latter being carriers who do not have business class. There is an unspoken expectation that if you upgrade, you will be allowed to use the lounge. Long story short, wrong. We flew from Paris to Detroit. Stopped in Detroit, MI for a few days, then flew to Reno, NV. We were able to use the business lounge in Paris, but not able to use the business lounge in Detroit, stating that we could only use it if we continue on to Reno on the same day. Or basically flying continuously around the world? WTF? I am not trying to be entitled or ask for special treatment, but when you pay for business or first class tickets, there is an expectation that you can use the lounges. So I tweeted to Delta and they asked me to PM them with my complaint/feedback. Response I got, it’s basically their policy, and they’re not making exceptions. Again, I was not asking for special treatment nor do I feel as though I am entitled, but there is an expectation when you pay 3-times that of economy. I write this to let other’s know, because you have choices for around the world tickets.

While Delta did provide food for the many people waiting, it certainly was not very good (cheap pizza and water) and not enough for everyone. They even ran out of plates for people. Finally, when the plane arrived, the passengers were told that the crew could no longer work, and we were forced to wait another 3.5 hours while they tried to find a crew.

First was called by Delta the partner in the flight with KLM, called and told us they were changing our flight with a 24 hr lay over ""as crew couldn't find a place to stay for the night in Panama City due to the storm"". Never mind that we looked up and found several places on the beach. In any event, this meant we would have to add another day of expense and change our flights to 5:55 AM, meaning we also lost all ability to submit our VAT refunds among other things, but the worst was yet to come. On checking in the 'lady' at the gate told us we could not carry on our policy size and weight carry on bags, as the ""flight was full"", yet the bags had important medical equipment, medicines and fragile expensive goods that we had no ability to lock up as we were told the bags would be able to be carried on. If the bags were lost or damaged replacing the equipment and meds would be extremely hard even once back home. The worst part-every other passenger behind us and at other gates for the same flight were being allowed to carry on their bags as advertised. CWhen confronted about why this was the case the gate attendant told us ""call direct if you like its in the policy fine print, we can do this to you"" She then became belligerent and gave one word answers, didnt look at us and said 'next"". When I tried to ask if wheelchair assistance had been confirmed, she spouted off a series of gate numbers where I could go ask for a wheelchair, and rushed us out of line. I then returned to the gate as her info wasn't sufficient, and asked another gate attendant who simply stuck her finger in the air and said ""over there somewhere"" and didn't even look at us.  Wheelchair assistance either wasn't at the gates or was very late and we had short connect flights and couldn't just hope it showed up. My son and wife  had to almost carry me at a run to the next gate. The only connection this didn't happen at was Atlanta and then only because we we hunted down a wheelchair attendant when ours wasn't there. The gate attendants were disrespectful, dismissive, and left us genuinely concerned given my inability to walk the distances due to legitimate neurological disease for which I carried medical proof- They forced us to check bags that others were carrying on board -passengers of the same ticket class as us.

First leg of the outbound was delayed on the tarmac due to flow control into Delta's Minneapolis hub, where I was to transfer.

I arrived at MSP about 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to depart. The Delta app said my gate was a 12-minute walk. However, I'd gate-checked my bag, so I was still in jeopardy of missing the connection. When I stepped off the plane I was met in the jetway by a Delta staffer who solved all my problems by escorting me to a car on the tarmac, where we grabbed my bag from the baggage handler, and shot off through a tunnel under the C and G concourses, directly to my connection.

When I used the Delta mobile app to check in for our return flight to RSW, we were given 5 middle seats (737 seats b and e) throughout the plane. We didn't get 2 seats together. When travelling with children (9, 12, and 14) that is not disastrous, but still sucks. When I asked the Atlanta check in staff if there was anything they could do for us, that is when I really experienced how Delta feels about basic economy tickets. The check in person was very friendly and helpful until he saw what type of fare we had purchased. His demeanor and helpfulness completely changed as he informed us that our tickets were take any seat class. We went to customer service and received the same treatment, even after telling the rep the ages of our girls. At the gate we tried again, and this gentleman was even more discourteous. He told us he wouldn't even look to see if there were seats available for moving us. When we got on the plane (last - zone 4), several passengers saw our predicament and offered to move to accommodate us. We didn't ask them to. Nice to see there are good people flying on Delta even if the people running it are jerks. We fly often and usually on Frontier, Allegiant, Jet Blue, and Southwest Airlines without difficulty. No other airline has embarrassed me or belittled me for choosing to fly economy with them. Bottom line is, if you buy a published basic economy fare on Delta Airlines, be prepared to be admonished and treated like you don't deserve to be on their plane.",None,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Fort Myers,September 2018,no,4,5,4,5,1,0,3
"""getting rid of the Delta card""",2018-09-07,3,Sherri Walls,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a first class trip for two on Delta Airlines using my Delta Sky-miles Platinum Card. We were flying from La Guardia to Houston. It’s about a four hour flight. For me, any flight over two hours I tend to fly first class. Unless, the ticket value is exceptional. Although I’ve held this card for sometime now, I’ve only flown first class twice on Delta. I generally use Delta to fly to Atlanta, which is approximately two hours. Anyway, the trip began with the rep at the gate informing us that we wouldn’t be able to sit together due to a broken seat. I was like that blows but whatever. Then I thought to ask the Delta Rep if maybe they could simply inquire with the passenger; who one of would be sat next to, if they didn’t mind switching to a different seat (still in first class but with no on occupying the seat next to it). I was told by the Delta Rep, that I should do it myself. Which, if that’s their policy, I get! He offered no other remedy. Maybe he could’ve said: hey, I realize it’s a bit of an inconvenience, separating you and if it’s important for you to be seated together; I could move you but you’d be losing first class service (which is much on Delta anyway). I just felt that there was no regard for professionalism. It matter of fact and deal with it attitude. The kicker was this, we boarded the plane and the “first class” Stewardess was no prize either. I will give this though, she did assist in getting us seated together. She then took drink and food orders. My order was taken first. Apparently, too many people ordered the chicken salad dish. She came back to me and here’s the dialogue: I can’t give you the chicken dish, you’ll have to have the pastrami sandwich. I said well I’ll pass, because I don’t eat pastrami. But how does that work anyway, you told me my choices and I selected like everyone else? She says we ran out of the chicken. I say, but you took my order first? She says well in looking at the medallion status, you fall to the bottom. What was so crazy about that is that I purchased both first class tickets and she brings my boyfriend the chicken salad! We both laughed like hell! Again, to her defense it could only be the Delta Airline to blame. No ideal how she decided he got to eat over me though. There is clearly no  training on tact or etiquette. And if I’m wrong in that statement; there is either no policy in place for common occurrences. The whole point of this review is to hopefully save anyone from wasting money on Delta first class. I’ve flown first class on American Airlines quite a few times also and have had zero complaints. Their planes even appear to be nicer. The meal thing wouldn't happen either as you select it 30 days to 24 hours before your flight. I’ll be getting rid of the Delta card.

When I tried to talk to Delta employees again, I discovered there were none at the airport anymore (it was 3 pm) and there was no one at the airport I could talk about my situation. On the following day, I returned to the airport to try to solve the situation with a Delta employee and I was told my luggage had arrived on the flight from New York that was landing at that time but they couldn't hand me my bag because it had to go through customs.

I didn't stay at a hotel and the building didn't have a doorman and no one would be there to pick it up.

We were originally booked to fly to NYC on August 4th and back on August 5th for a weekend trip, and that flight was delayed for 2 hours and then cancelled after a very short time, and I'm about 99% sure this was due to a mechanical issue. We rebooked for the next weekend on the same flights (August 11th-August 12th), and the gate agent was willing to upgrade us to first class. Sounds great, right? I guess it would've if that had actually worked out. That flight was delayed for 3 hours and then cancelled AGAIN. Now, this time, it was due to weather, which they can't control; however, this is the first time I've been cancelled due to weather. In the past, I've been delayed for a long time, but not cancelled. We rebooked on another flight, this was 3 hours later, and it gets delayed due to weather/late inbound flight, and once it finally makes it to the gate, we get ready to board, and then the gate agent announces that the flight was cancelled again literally just as the plane is about to board. Some airlines like to keep delaying the flight and are really hesitant to cancel, where as Delta just decides to give up and cancel the flights.

We're just customers going to go to New York,"" and the one woman that was standing next to him gave another sarcastic remark, and then they walked away.

Gate agent told my 16 year old daughter that since the fee was not paid there was nothing she could do. My wife had to speak to gate agent on speaker phone to even get her to do basic customer service. The lack of compassion this gate agent showed is appalling. Regardless of any additional fees paid or not the safety of a minor should have been Delta Airlines main priority. Leaving a minor stranded without rectifying the issue is unacceptable. It should not have taken a call from an adult to fix. She knows her job she chose to be lazy and do the bare minimum or actually even less than that. With all the bad press Delta has been receiving you would think that retraining your agents would be a priority. Shame on you Delta Airlines for leaving a 16 year old kid crying hysterically and doing nothing to solve the problem.

Our trip from Washington DC to Detroit was a short bearable trip as it was an hour but this past trip was horrible as having my children with randoms spread across the plane is a horrible way to treat a family. Upon calling to fix our seating the situation got worse, the computer system told us they would call us back in 3 hours . This is ridiculous customer service.

We were told the flight had been delayed for 10 mins. Come back the flight is delayed for another 10 mins. Come back again and the lady said if it is anywhere past 6:20 we have to come to the front to change our flights as we would miss our connecting. Again totally fine, I am in a line up with one person in front of me awaiting the new update (currently states 6:20 departure) - flights delayed until 8:45pm - again totally fine. Then things start going south. The line was told if we wanted faster service to take a red card and call the number to change flights so I take a card and step out of line as I had to meet my boyfriend to let him know what was happening. I call the airline and there isn't a single flight that night until the next day. Ok that sucks but fine... we both have to book off work the next day now and so I asked politely if there was anything that they could do to make the situation better (aka seat upgrade). Nope notta. Fine. Well can I continue booking my hotel then as I would hope you cover that. Sorry mam, but you have to go to the ladies at the gate to book a room - so now I have to go back to the same line I was encouraged to step out, again 1 person in front of me before. 1 and 1/2 hours later (4 hours since arriving at the airport) finally get to the front- again. I explain to the same lady who told me to step out of the line what happened and again politely asked for anything to make the situation better - again nothing. Standard hotel room and food vouchers which are only good at the airport  which we cant use for the meal we already ate while waiting for the delays. Then on our first flight they didn't seat us together and on the second connecting flight (2.5 hours) there were no TV's . This was pretty ridiculous there was zero customer service in handling the situation. We had to take another vacation day which we couldn't even take advantage of because anything worth going to in San Diego takes a full day. At the end of all of it they couldn't at least put us in Premium economy or give us credit we could use for something outside of spending more time at the airport or upgrade our room. I strongly suggest not taking this airline.

When I booked tickets on the Delta website earlier this year to fly from London to Costa Rica I got all the way to the final screen without any problems only to find that when I clicked 'Buy' a pop up screen appeared telling me that there was now a high demand for these seats and if I wanted them I'd have to pay a couple of hundred dollars more. Delta might find this to be a great way to screw extra money out of your customers (and after all, they are an American company) and it might even be legal; but it's dishonest, unethical and just plain wrong. I've never known this from any other airline in over 40 years of flying. Secondly, as we flew over the Atlantic my wife and I were on the extreme right hand side of the plane, the guy on the same row in seat A had his window open - everyone else had their windows closed as the sun was low and very bright. This caused everyone in the row to have very bright sunlight in their eyes, we all complained to the stewardess who told us that the guy needed to work on his computer and so needed the window open to see the keyboard, I have to note that the window was partially closed so there was no sunlight in his eyes, just everyone elses. No matter how many times we complained the stewardess refused to tell the guy to close the window, so this went on for several hours, it made it difficult to see the entertainment, it made it impossible to sleep and it  made the whole experience very unpleasant.  Given the way several US airlines have treated their passengers over the past year I doubt that I'll ever fly on an American carrier again, they obviously don't care about passengers.

Me and my husband booked our flights from Tel Aviv to Portland and vice versa via CheapOair, flying with KLM, Delta  and Air France. The departing flights with a layover in Amsterdam ( with KLM) were great, however the returning flights operated by Delta and Air France were an horrendous experience! It began 2 days before our departure. We received an email notification that our returning flights have been rescheduled. We were not satisfied with the change, and spent more than an hour on an international call with cheapOair customer service to make sure we will depart at the original time and will remain seated together. While booking we paid to CheapOair to ensure we will be seated together, and they ensured us that even though the assigned seats may change, we will be together. In the updated itinerary all seemed OK, and we left for our trip thinking it is. When we checked in to our departing flights the evening before (3 flights with layovers in Seattle and Paris) we were shocked to see we were seated separately in all of them! Air France from Paris to Tel Aviv was the worst, with me being seated in the first rows and my husband in the back. What was even worse is we saw on one of the flights there was a free seat next to my husband, but to choose it meant to pay 60$ extra. Why would they separate us in the first place when there were seats available? Were we suppose to pay for something we already paid for?! We tried to call to Delta customer service, only to wait for more than 2 hours. Left our local sim number and they called back after 3 hours, said they transfer me to international flights customers service, and this time had to wait for another half an hour, left my number and they never called back.

Next to the gate however were phones direct to customer service, on which luckily there wasn't any wait time, but the representative wasn't very helpful. When she was told all that we've been through she was silent and couldn't help us reassign the seats. She sent us to the gate to try and fix that. At the gate, representative got us new seats together on our flights from USA to Paris in a few moments. When asked what was the problem to do so from the beginning, she blamed it on Air France in Paris rescheduling one of the original flights and said it also caused the mess with the seats. She also couldn't reassign our seats from Paris to Tel Aviv. When boarded on the plane to Paris, we had a delay of a half an hour because safety buckles were missing and waited for the crew to bring it. After a long wait, apparently they brought the wrong buckles and had to return with the right once. We were afraid we were going to miss our next flight. The flight to Tel Aviv was not any better. Once again, there were seats together we were reassigned to without any problem, and yet again there was a delay of half an hour after boarding because the water system of the plane needed to be checked.

My outbound flight to MSP was delayed so much that I missed the connecting flight to SAN. Once I arrived in MSP, I was directed to the service desk for assistance. The Service Desk agent displayed absolutely no empathy and told me my next flight out was going to be with an additional connection through LAX. So I was originally going to get to SAN around 1pm. Now with the delays and re-route this was going to push me back to 9pm. I asked at the service desk if they compensate their customers in any way and she said ""Well, if you were here more than 8 hours we would give you a meal voucher and Delta feels if they get you there within 24 hours then that is the best they can do."" Her words, not mine. I was floored. So I asked her to terminate my trip in LAX and I would get my own transportation from there to SAN instead of sitting in the airport another two hours. I get to LAX and no bag! I ran like a mad woman to baggage services so that they could keep my bag from going on the connecting flight to SAN. The agent there was emotionless as he put a note in the computer and he told me to wait 20 minutes until they respond. I said ""Uhm, can you call them please? I would like to get my bag and leave.""

We paid higher than the ""going rate"" for our flight especially because we wanted a smooth overnight return so that we could return to work the day after return. The flight over was very good, we were impressed. But, our connection from Richmond to our NY overseas flight was suddenly cancelled. The ground crew hardly knew how to cope with such. They claimed it much be weather, though had no idea. As their flights to other NY airports were flying, and the weather report looked fine this could not be the case. After much back and forth we were routed through Atlanta (still suffering from the hurricanes) and then Amsterdam. This was the longest return we'd ever experienced in our 30 years of regular travel between the UK/US. Needless to say we could not return to work the following day as planned. So initially we were very disappointed at how poorly Delta handled our return. We can only assume that the flight was cancelled because they hadn't the numbers, and thus the profit. This was the first clue of a problem. The confused and almost useless ground staff the second clue. Note that we had to work with them for a realistic return as their initial proposal did not allow adequate lay-over time in Atlanta given the airport size. Then on return I wrote a complaint to Delta. Next clue was that complaints are automated through a soulless computer process. Then I was warned that they were experiencing a high volume to customer service requests and while they hoped to answer in 30 days they could not promise. 30+ days, seriously? Well they passed our complaint, about Delta's handling of our custom, over the KLM who few the transatlantic flight. They must never had even read the complaint.

Absolutely disgusted by all this. Only this morning they took the initiative to give out some drinks and muffins to those with newly delayed flights. Clearly the media’s hitting hard but what about the rest of us who endured 12hrs last night, held hostage and treated like cattle in dirt with no food or bedding? Utterly disgusting and to top it all off, my sister just asked for a pillow from a Delta employee and her rude response was “I was handing them out at 2 last night, they’re all gone, what do you want me to do about it?” No care, no kindness, no sympathy - just a mockery of what we’re having to go through.",None,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to London,January 2018,no,1,1,0,1,1,0,1

(We knew we were losing the extra money for her Savannah flights but she was keeping her same seat on her Atlanta flights) I waited on hold for three hours to let Delta know she will no longer need the flights I paid for from Savannah to Atlanta and from Atlanta to Savannah. I was then informed it would cost an additional $448 to allow her to check in in Atlanta. As a result, she drove 3.5 hours to Savannah to make the Savannah flight. The day before the flight, I tried to check all of us in; however, my sister was no longer on the itinerary anywhere. So i waited an additional 1.5 hours to see why she was no longer on the itinerary. Turns out the delta rep who tried to change her flight information gave her a different itinerary number. To compensate, Delta gave us a $100 voucher to use to purchase any delta tickets. On the flight home she did not board as she needed to stay in Atlanta. So I allowed my nephew to sit in her seat that I already paid for. Deltas employees then made him get up and go to his assigned seat in the main cabin so one of their pilots could sit in the first class seat I paid for!

I got there at 11:35am as the security line was pretty long. When I boarded the plane it looked almost full. The only thing I had with me was 1 carry on. I could not find space in the first class section, so I walked down to about the 15th row of seats and could not find a space for it all. I decided to go backup to the front and let the flight attendant know about my situation. The line of the passengers behind me was building up as they were boarding the plane trying to get to their seats while I was trying to get back to the front. The flight attendant saw me and noticed that I was trying to get back up to the front. I was able to tell her my problem, She gave me the most nasty attitude as if it was my fault that there was no more room on the plane for my carry on. I was in shock - a first class customer struggling with my carry on and here she is acting like if it was my fault!

"""domestic crew are far less professional""",2017-11-10,7,J Mackay,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew New York JFK to Philadelphia. This flight did not last a full hour and I must mention that there is a marked difference between the friendliness of the international crew of Delta and the domestic crew of Delta. The domestic crew are far less professional on their behavior and attitude to passengers onboard. My connecting flight from Italy to New York arrived on time however the bags were placed late on the belt and by the time I made it through US customs and walked from gate 14 to 33 because no one in JFK was willing to help I arrived at the plane seconds before they closed the door. Upon entering the aircraft I was surprised because the flight attendant told me to sit in seat 4 D (Business Class) I thought this was due to the delay as a way of saying thank you I quickly found out she made a mistake and in front of everyone asked me to leave the cabin (I was embarrassed to say the least), realizing what she had done she offered me a ""Comfort Seat"", to be honest I did not notice any difference between that seat and a regular seat on coach. I have to say the aircraft looked brand new, clean and before I could buckle my seatbelt we were already in Philadelphia. Delta’s iPhone app is great for tracking your bags and other flight related info. My only observation is the marked difference between the domestic and the international crew. Overall I would fly Delta again, the planes look and feel new, clean, the seats and space are better than their other US competitors.

I was hoping to get their signature airplane, the new Airbus 350 however the equipment we flew in Airbus 330 was very nice. Upon boarding I asked one of the flight attendants if I could move to an empty row and she was very nice and said to me that I could grab any seat I wished so I went on and sat on an empty row of 2. I have attached multiple pictures to show the menu with the great choices they give you (in coach!), the airplane had Wi-Fi for the entire nine hour flight, however I must mention that the entertainment was not good. The TV shows and the music channels were not working. To be honest that was not a deterrent because I was thrilled with the Wi-Fi and thanks to my T-Mobile plan I had one free hour plus unlimited texting on Messenger and WhatsApp. I usually fly internationally on European or Asian airlines because the service provided by US-based companies is poor however Delta is changing this and they are a strong competitor in this route up to par with European-based airlines, they can’t match the Asian airlines yet but compared to other US companies they provide a superior service and I would fly Delta international again for sure. I must make an observation about Delta’s new ""Comfort Seat"" I’m not sure it’s worth the money because I did not see a difference between that seat and the one I had.

It's the best flying across the country on a 767 since it's spacious and you don't have to pass 2 people to go out of your seat if you have a window seat. Really surprised that on this flight delta provided complimentary lunch for all classes (even economy!) The beef pastrami sandwich was so good it made into one of the best pastrami I've ever had!

"""business class old and outdated""",2017-11-03,5,K Sheares,"✅ Verified Review |  Munich to Tampa via Atlanta. First time I have flown Delta internationally as it is not an airline I typically fly or prefer. But due to an attractive airfare from Germany to Florida in business class I decided to give it a try. I was shocked about the age of the plane and the seating for business class. Both are old and outdated. I read Delta decided to keep its aging aircraft and not turn over for newer aircraft and clearly this route is one of those where the older planes are utilized. Their terminal location at the Munich airport is in keeping with their aircraft, old beat up, primitive and a lot of cattle herding before boarding the aircraft. Once onboard and into my seat I realized the business class seats were really out of date in both design and fittings. The video system failed and was unavailable for the flight which was a real drag for 9.4 hours. The provided headphones were cheap copies of Bose which in other airlines is a standard for business and first class. (Return flight I will be sure to download movies and bring my own headset.) The food service looked good but the chicken meal was so overcooked and the cooked spinach was filled with grit. The light meal served before landing in Atlanta was so salty I could not eat it either. So both meals were inedible and a good thing I had a solid breakfast before boarding the flight. Seat was comfortable but very tight unless one is 150 lbs and under 5'10"". A blanket and good size pillow was provided which helped. Bottled water was provided so one did not have to ring for the flight attendant for something to drink. Because of the configuration of the 767 the bathroom was behind business class and attached next to the food preparation area for coach passengers. This also meant sharing those bathrooms with coach passengers as well. Though I never had to wait for a free bathroom. Again, old plane with a older design compared to the new standards most airlines now have for their bread and butter business class passengers. OK for the much talked about service model that Delta staff employ for its business class passengers is true they do really try hard to be charming and helpful but I suspect it is to cover up all the Delta deficiencies has using these out of date aircraft. But in the end it did not help the fact the food was terrible, the video system did not work and the airport waiting, boarding process was much akin to a SouthWest experience.",Boeing 767-400,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Tampa via Atlanta,October 2017,no,2,3,1,0,3,3,3

That's at least $300 less then other airlines economy class running the Asia route vs Delta's premium Comfort plus. The staff was nice and accommodating, despite there being some confusion with Incheon crew, I think they were in training or new staff cause they seemed a bit nervous so minus a star there. Flight wise, food was above average in taste with 3 selections, not your mom's home cooking but satisfying. Best of all, the free Starbucks and Bailey's on the house and other drink selection was a fantastic touch. Free messaging wifi helped me kept in contact with those below and organize schedules. (Kakao Talk worked, even though it was not on the list of usable apps, so I think any messaging app is ok as long as you don't send pictures or files you're fine.)

They just don't care that passengers might prefer to keep their possessions with them (which I do, having had checked luggage not arrive with me more times than I can count). Thirdly, seats are very uncomfortable, forcing everyone into a hunched position. One positive is that the last couple planes I've been on have had more leg room and wider aisles than I'm used to.

I called JustFly (the online ticketing agency) and Delta to request a refund for the return trip due to the fact that my son will not be in Florida due to the cancelled flight (if he is not in Florida, he cannot utilize a flight from Florida). Justfly said they needed some sort of waiver from Delta to process a cancellation and refund, Delta said that the flight was not affected by Harvey and therefore there will be no refund.

In both directions, YYJ-SEA legs were served by SkyWest using CRJ-700 aircraft; SEA-ATL legs used B757 outbound and A321 for the return; ATL-DCA legs used A321s in both directions. For all legs, interior cabins were clean and modern (even the B757, a model that Boeing stopped manufacturing in 2003). A321s were brand-new, but nevertheless had the seating design problem of wasting several centimetres of available fuselage width owing to an unnecessary gap between the window-seat armrests and fuselage. A321s also had the new narrower washroom design. A pregnant or significantly overweight passenger would have difficulty turning around inside. Delta categorizes its passengers under many rubrics – Comfort Class, Comfort+ Class, Delta One Class, SkyPriority Class, Medallion Class, Premium Cabin, Main Cabin, and so on. The only clearly-named category I recognised was ""First Class"". I didn't think any of my flights had a ""First Class"", but, on one of my outbound flights, the gate agents nevertheless announced it as one of the groups for early boarding (even in advance of parents with small children and passengers using wheelchairs!). By the end of my trip, I discovered that my ""Comfort+ Class"" ticket was considered also to be in the ""Premium Cabin"" and ""SkyPriority Class"" categories, which all overlapped. A full set of definitions should have been provided as part of the ticket. IFE offered a decent selection of audio and video, but the categorisation made no sense: better to look for the full A-Z listing. For Comfort+ class, ""snacks"" were offered; but the only real food was a banana. Alcoholic beverages were supposed to be available without additional charge for Comfort+ passengers, but at no time did the FAs explicitly say so. Outbound, the ATL-DCA leg was cancelled, as were three other Delta flights that evening serving the same route. Delta apologised profusely, explaining that thunderstorms in the US northeast corridor had prevented flights from landing at DCA and mentioning air-traffic-control congestion as a contributing factor. Oddly, after I arrived in Washington the next day, friends told me they could recall no rain or thunderstorms in Washington the night before. Passengers on the cancelled flights were required to stay overnight at ATL at our own expense. Many passengers did their own rebooking of flights online. Only one Delta agent was present at the service counter near the gate to do rebooking in person. Nearby were Delta telephones where rebooking agents could be reached, but few people noticed them. For overnight lodging, Delta gave us a print-out saying that it had a ""negotiated rate"" with a nearby motor hotel, although it didn't make an outright recommendation. It was a seedy place, well worn and with visible damage to walls and fixtures. It is unwise for Delta to associate its name with that motor hotel. I had one G&T; on the ATL-SEA return leg.

I bought the flight on Delta.Com and despite have a 1:04 connection time in ATL did not see the timing as a problem.

While in the terminal waiting to reboard I asked a Redcoat to notify ATL of my close connection and asked for “meet and assist” help upon arrival. I watched him type in the request and listened as he read it to me. We arrived in ATL on an A gate with 24 minutes to spare – my AMS departure was leaving from an E gate. Of course, no one was there to assist and the one gate agent had his hands full with normal gate arrival activities. While running to the connections train I saw on a departures board that the AMS flight, which had been showing on-time on the Delta mobile app, was now delayed 30 minutes.

The flight attendants on this trip flying from Montana to Phoenix via Salt Lake City have been terrible - they are completely rude and have to awareness of how to cater to family travelers. The flight attendants tried to make us check our car seat multiple times even though the manufacturer website clearly shows the seat is airline approved. Also we have a Chico key fit 30 which is one of the most popular car seats sold and I would hope before trying to make us check it unnecessarily they would be up to date on the most commonly approved seats. A child can sit in a lap with no seat so I do not see the issue for what seat is traveled with. After throwing a big fuss over our seat and getting management involved and all the other passengers involved telling them it is approved they finally with disgruntled looks on their faces ""let"" us use the seat as an exception! They acted like they were doing a favor by not having us check the seat when it is clearly approved on the website.

Throughout the ordeal the station attendants were helpful, even when passenger tensions were rising, they remained professional. They even helped some passengers with connecting flights and got them on another flight. After the delay the flight crew were amazing. The pilots got out of the cockpit and addressed everyone face-to-face and apologized for the long delay, which to me showed a high sense of professionalism. The free alcoholic drinks in premium economy were excellent. The snacks were suffice for a short 60 minute flight, just some cookies and pretzels.

We were directed by an announcement that we had to go to a certain area in the airport to ascertain what to do next. We arrived at the named area and there was a queue. After waiting for about thirty minutes a staff member came out and said that we should go to another area. This we did it was a long way to go we reached the area and again a queue - after about thirty minutes we got to the desk. I iterated to the staff member that we had been travelling for over 20 hours and I was very sore. The staff member asked my wife to go around the back to look at the screen. I was unable to and also never asked to. The staff member was showing my wife that we were entitled to a hotel because I was disabled. I find this distasteful as surely anyone delayed due to the airline failings were entitled. Anyway we asked how we should get there and produced a voucher for a taxi. We were then told how to get to the taxi stand. I asked about our bags as my medication was in there. We were told to go to another office which was baggage claim.

This reservation was done over the phone since I needed the assistance of a Delta agent to book a ticket from JNB to HRE and from HRE to JNB. When it came to checking in 24 hours prior to my trip on the 1st of May, the online system would not let me check in online. I had to call a Delta agent to assist with checking in. After being on the phone for over an hour, the agent had to redo my reservation under a new record locator and confirmation number. According to this agent, the reason why it would not let me check in was because there was a Date of Birth mismatch. The agent assured me that my seating remained intact, and just the confirmation had changed. I was finally able to check in. When boarding at RIC airport, all of a sudden, the agent gave me a new seat number which was NOT the original seat number I reserved. When I arrived in ATL, my boarding pass wouldn't scan. I was supposed to board with the SKY priority zone, but could not. I was supposed to be on seat 31F which was a delta comfort seat. The agent told me that they were checking to see if my luggage had transferred to the flight. I thought that was an odd response. All of a sudden, I have a new boarding pass with a new seat number 53E and they just reassigned me with no notice or explanation. I located the seat thinking it was another Delta Comfort seat, but it my dismay, it was a basic economy class seat. I reported this mix up immediately to one of the stewardess. She got the agent that reassigned my seat. This agent claimed they did not have a record of my purchasing economy comfort seat, yet it was on the documentation that I presented to him. I insisted that I wanted my original seat back, but of course he was totally unwilling to help or do anything to look into it.He totally disregarded me and ignored everything i had to say and walked away. Now, I was told to take the economy seat as there were not delta comfort seats available as the plane was getting ready to takeoff. I had no choice but to do so. As a delta skymiles member, I was lied to by these agents and was very disrespected. If Skymiles members are treated this way and based on this experice, I will certainly cancelling my skymiles membership and delta gold credit card after being treated like trash. I also will not be recommending delta as customer service oriented airline. In my opinion, Delta demonstrated bad business practice, by relinquishing my comfort seat when it was already paid for.

We were just married two weeks ago and we have plans to spend a week in the East Caribbean. We purchased economy tickets with Delta Airlines because, as one would expect, we were on a close budget while saving for the wedding. We followed up with check in procedure, signing in to schedule our seating at 4:33pm, 24 hours before our flight. The check in opened at 4:30pm on May 18th. 3 minutes into check in all of the seats were booked. So on our honeymoon we are having to sit separately. My husband then called Delta Airlines and spoke to a representative that stated it was a full flight, and for us to speak to the front desk representative at our terminal for accommodations. We arrive at the airport today and waited in line. After hearing an announcement stating that there are several unassigned seats currently and not to worry, that a seat assignment would be given to the individuals when they board the plane. When we did our check in yesterday we had a choice of 2 separate individual seats rows apart from each other even though we booked our tickets 7 whole months in advance. The representative greeted us when we came up to the desk and let us know that no accommodations would be made for our situation even though it was a special occasion for us. She brushed us off and asked us to please take a seat. I am dissappointed. We recently flew with Delta earlier this year and I was highly impressed with their level of organization and professionalism. We travelled with our family of 14 people and were able to book 3 full rows of seats for our whole family with no issues.

The captains of the plane struck up conversation before boarding and were very friendly. When we boarded the flight attendants asked our names, where we were from and treated us like gold. But, then we got to Minneapolis. We asked politely if there were any upgrades available and the gate agent answered the most condescending ""you do that when you book. Who told you that you could come here and ask me for this?!"" I was stunned. Not just stunned frankly insulted and angered. Paying customers should never be treated with such contempt and outright disgust. Delta who claims to put there customers first in this instance treated us like mere nuisances.

Of the 16 of us, baggage was delayed for 5!! For one person, it was delayed for 2 days (out of a 7 day trip!). The Guatemalan baggage attendant did not provide a file reference number to us (which we needed for baggage charge reimbursement purposes), so I just completed an online letter to them explaining why I cannot complete their online form (wasting more of my time). Additionally, on the trip home, we actually happened to get upgraded to a ""comfort plus"" seat. The desk attendant told us it cost an extra $100 for these seats and we would get a complementary drink if we desired. The leg room was definitely better, but that was it. We were never offered any drink, and the service/attention we received was no different than in economy - which, in my opinion, was also sub-par.

"""consider flying with Delta again""",2017-02-24,8,J Choo,"✅ Verified Review |  New York to Buffalo return. On both flights, check-in and luggage drop-off at the airports were a breeze with hardly any need to queue. Several check-in desks were available. On my return flight, I reached the airport about 1.5 hours to departure and again, there was no need to queue. There were many kiosks available for self check-ins. Baggage drop-off and counter check-ins all took place at the counters. I appreciated the ease of joining a single queue that handled both check-in and baggage drop-off. The customer service person attended to my check-in baggage, tagged it, and brought it straight to the conveyor belt behind the counter, all in one station. This was so much easier compared to another US airline I flew with last year, also out from JFK, where I had to join 3 separate queues at 3 separate stations: one for check-in, then another one to have my luggage weighed and tagged, and a third station to drop off my baggage. The areas surrounding these 3 stations were, needless to say, crowded. chaotic and messy. For the passengers, I cannot imagine it being a superior experience than having one station that handles everything from check-ins to luggage drop-off. Boarding for both flights were orderly and according to frequent flyer status, premium or economy seats and zones. The planes were small and did not have a lot of storage space was available but the airline allows passengers to place their larger hand carry bags at the aero bridge prior to boarding which were then brought by handlers to be loaded in the cargo hold. On the out-going flight, free pretzels, cookies or peanuts were offered to passengers in economy with free drinking water. On the return flight, there were free pretzels or cookies with free water, tea, coffee and I believe soft drinks too. The captains made announcements at the beginning of each flight on the traffic at the airport and the expected take off time. The outgoing flight was on time but the return flight experienced a 20 mins delays. Passengers were able to access entertainment programmes like movies, sticoms, etc, through their own devices by logging into Delta Studio using the wifi onboard. The access to the entertainment programme which had a good selection of American and foreign movies is free. This was my first short haul experience with Delta.

It's for the gate agent. The lady working the gate in Atlanta at B29 on 2/23 for the flight to Charlotte at 3:10pm needs some serious lessons in customer service. I understand they have policies and protocols but there's really no need to be blatantly rude to your customers about it. I fly almost weekly with a carry on (that I'm almost always forced to check at the gate), my computer bag and a small purse. The purse can fit inside the computer bag but I wear it as a cross body and just slide it in the computer bag when I get to my seat. As I am walking into the tarmac she makes me stop and consolidate my tiny purse into my laptop bag. After a quick argument saying that it'll fit, I fly with this all the time she forces me to step aside, so I did and then I backed up to be out of the way and she proceeds to yell at me for where I choose to stand and then essentially makes fun of me to the next passenger boarding saying that I clearly didn't understand her the first ten times she said it. For the record, I heard her and I know the rules. I fly enough with the same 3 items and I'm never given a hard time about it. So if she enforces her rules more than others, bravo to a job well done but at least do it with some finesse and class. She's just rude and unprofessional. This is Delta, not a low class airline. The best part was, after I consolidated, they forced me to check my carry on anyways. She could have suggested that from the getgo instead of making a spectacle of me.

Once I was given a boarding pass, I asked the ground crew if it was still OK to bring my carry-on with me, and they said ""yes."" When I finally boarded, however, the attendant said there was no overhead room left for my carry-on and that I needed to walk back to the gate and check it. I've never been treated so badly by an airline, for no apparent reason. Their policy seems to be to overbook and let the passengers and gate-keepers sort it out.

"""have not changed their stripes""",2017-01-14,3,C Lang,"✅ Verified Review |  Bonaire to Salt Lake City via Atlanta. There were a number of issues on this flight - some beyond the control of the airline. But Delta failed to cater an international flight of over 5 hours duration. There were no first class meals at all and not enough coach meals to go around. Passengers were asked to share which was OK because the sandwich they provided to me was soggy - almost soaking wet and smelled so bad I refused to eat it in any event. Beverages were also in short supply and at the end of the flight as a first class passenger I was offered a choice of Diet Coke or tomato juice only. According to staff the plane should have been catered for the return flight in Atlanta and that did not get done. Flight crew advised that they had asked the terminal staff in Bonaire to make an announcement that if you wanted food or drink you needed to buy it before boarding. If that was done neither myself or anyone I talked to in first class heard the announcement. Flight crew promised that Delta would have a representative at the gate in Atlanta to do something for our inconvenience - that was a pipe dream. Due to the delays I had to run to clear customs, immigration and make my next flight out of Atlanta - also in the first class cabin but with no meal service. So I had a 12 hour travel day with a soggy, inedible sandwich and two bags of chips. I am a frequent business traveler and I avoid Delta whenever I can because they always lose bags, have issues with departure times etc etc. My first Delta flight since 2011 shows they have not changed their stripes.",None,Business,First Class,BON to SLC via ATL,January 2017,no,4,1,1,4,1,3,1

Finally, I was assisted with redeeming my e-credit but only to find out that it didn't even come close to covering the cost of flying NM to CA (this was a credit from NM to Iceland!), and furthermore, the flight times and number of transfers was atrocious (8 hours of travel time, to go 3 states away - 8 hours).

We were reassured at Heathrow that rebooking would be taken care of. There was no further information at any point other than vague and empty reassurances after which we had to wait in a queue for immigration control for one and half hours. By this time I had a migraine and felt very unwell from the stress of the entire situation. After another queue at re-booking queue of 30 minutes were we told that there were no further flights for the day and we were booked into the Holiday Inn South Hotel, and provided with food vouchers for an evening meal and breakfast. We lost a day of our holiday as a result. On our return journey 10/01/17, our flight was delayed again and we were not sure if we had missed the connecting flight to London Heathrow as again we were not given any information. We were very anxious about missing the flight again, and we left our camera on the aircraft. We were in a queue for immigration for two hours - no information was forthcoming despite repeated requests for information as it was likely we could be re-booked for the 09.37 flight later that evening. We were told by one of the border agents that if we did not like waiting that we should not visit the United States.

We were told that food vouchers could not be provided as this should have been given by the staff at the airport.

It started our holiday on a very bad note. On the return, early morning flight was delayed for mechanical reasons. However we reached Minneapolis in time to connect. But the connecting flight after travelling down the runaway, gathering speed, suddenly braked and returned to the gate - mechanical problems. An alternative plane was arranged and we reached home several hours later. The ground manager asked us to rate them high for having arranged a replacement plane -- what gall!

I believe it is the first time we've flown Delta, and we were impressed despite a few hiccups: In general the staff were professional and personable, there seemed to be a real priority on leaving/arriving on time, ground services were able to move passengers onto the plane in good time despite the challenges. Appreciated the free onboard movies and being able to download the gogo app real-time to play the movie, did not use Wi-Fi for Internet access. We got a super deal for this fare. Toronto to Detroit a smaller plane - we were all seated apart from each other, which was not optimal but we knew check-in seat assignment was a condition of the fare we purchased (just didn't realize it could be at the gate) - apparently our names were called at the gate but we did not hear the announcement, and by the time we got to the desk, these were the best seats we could get - one of my children is 10 years old, so I think the system should aim to seat a parent with a child that age or younger - seat assignments at the gate are a bit frustrating, you're in 1 line with a mix of customer issues which take a little to a lot of time to resolve - I stood in line for about 15 minutes only to be told that I would have to wait until my name was called - I was seated in a window seat, in row of two seats. When an obese passenger sat down beside me, I felt very squished (the passenger took ~ 1.5 seats) and I knew (being somewhat claustrophobic) that flying for an hour would not be a tolerable situation - I requested and was granted a seat change to a spare seat so that issue was resolved. However, I think Delta should have given this passenger two seats, it was unfair for both of us, and I'm not sure how the issue would have been resolved had there not been a spare empty seat. - flight was smooth and on time - we were very impressed Detroit to Philly - larger plane, we were able to check-in online and get these seat assignments then, we were all seated together, flight was on time - the landing was a bit hard.  Return from Philly to Detroit we were unable to check-in online for some reason, and the error message said we should speak with a Special Services agent at the airport for check-in. It was strange, unlike the online check-in process Toronto-Philly, where I was able to check all four of us in, this time the system separated the two adults, and each child into a separate party - ie. we received three email notifications to check-in separately (which didn't work and we could not check-in online) - we had to speak with a Special Services agent, who was able to seat two of us together (adjacent aisle seats) and the other two in separate areas of the plane. Flight was smooth and on time, they were overbooked (probably due to the previous flight issue) but this issue was resolved. Detroit to Toronto there wasn't enough room to accommodate everyone at the gate area (I believe a previous flight had been cancelled) -the gate was small, seemed more like a hallway. The agent in Philly was able to seat 3 of us, we had to get 1 seat assigned at the gate - flight was delayed because there was a problem closing the cargo door - other than that the flight was smooth, great landing.",None,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to PHL via DTW,November 2016,yes,4,4,3,5,4,4,5
"""Delta a very good surprise""",2016-11-03,9,Pascal Pierre Saunier,"I fly the Europe-Chicago route once to twice a year. I often fly AF-KLM and Delta was a very good surprise! I flew Delta on 23 October and my seat was 29F. Check in was fast since I was connecting in Amsterdam from a flight from Brussels. The aircraft was a 767 in a 2-3-2 layout. The pitch was average in the 31-32 inches and seats ok for economy. What came as a very good surprise was the meal and beverage service. We had a choice of 3 different dinners (one being vegetarian) and they came with an entrée, salad, cheese and dessert. We had a mid-flight snack in a small box and a pre-arrival sandwich. We also had ice cream. Beverages were served often and each was given a bottle of water. Coffee was good and wine and beer was complimentary. I beleive this was of my best economy class flights ever, better than Air France for sure. On the outbound flight, I had seat 10c on the Detroit-Amsterdam in an A330. Great legroom and worth the money. The ticket cost me €460 return and that inlcudes Comfort class from DTW to Amsterdam @ €89 one way. You can't find cheaper for Bru-Amst-MSP-Chicago-DTW-Ams-Brussels, and luggage was on time and no complain with my 15 kilo carry on either. Great experience and very kind staff.",Boeing 767,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,AMS to MSP,October 2016,yes,4,5,5,4,4,0,5
